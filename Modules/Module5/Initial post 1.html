<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Referring briefly to the reading; Weststeijn (2011), I
found it somewhat interesting to see the efforts to try to deduce the origins
of languages and which languages inspired which. However, the objective to
trace back to the “primitive language” spoken by Adam was an exercise in
futility driven by ulterior motives which I would have spoken more about here
had the conclusion not already delivered a similar punchline. Suffice to say
that I do not find this to be compelling evidence of ancient knowledge
representation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>The term “knowledge representation” seems to be relatively
new and created for the field of artificial intelligence (AI). I was unable to
trace back any further than Newell and Simon (1972) who discuss structuring and
encoding information as representing knowledge. However, the desire to
represent knowledge can be traced back much further. Venn (1881) discussed
symbolic logic as a way of representing logical relationships, including the now
famous Venn diagram. He was building upon work by Boole (1854), who proposed
that symbols could be used to represent logic, and gave us Boolean algebra. And
Boole even acknowledged Aristotle, who lived 384-322 BC, turning his rules into
equations. So it is clear that the desire to represent knowledge far predates
computer science, but the term knowledge representation is a more recent
invention aligned with AI.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Reasoning takes the represented knowledge and makes it
actionable when the knowledge is incomplete. In other words, it is not
necessary to specify every last detail as long as there is sufficient knowledge
to reason an outcome through deduction, induction, analogy etc. (Xue &amp; Zhu,
2009). Brachman &amp; Levesque (2004) described this as a system using information
to create a set of beliefs which go beyond the limits of the facts it was given.
In the field of AI, it would therefore seem that reasoning is the critical
additional part to elevate a system to one of “learning” or “intelligence”.
Knowledge representation on its own is simply a method for collecting,
structuring and encoding information. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>That said, having encoded the information into a knowledge
base, there is still value in simply being able to accurately and unambiguously
interrogate the information without any additional reasoning. If that were not the
case then the scholars mentioned above; Aristotle, Boole and Venn, would have
had little interest in their work, and all are famous names today. So knowledge
representation on it’s own does indeed have value, but reasoning elevates it to
a higher level.</span></p>
