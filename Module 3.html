												<h3>Reflections</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I approached this module with some trepidation given the long time since I studied anything mathematical. 
												It wasn’t especially easy starting the module because the first seminar was after two weeks, so it was all reading/self-study to begin with.
											</p>
											<p>Unit 1 lecturecasts gave a good introduction to R along with introducting methods of statistical measurement. 
												Reading for Unit 1 was not too bad, and R seems to be a fairly simple language so far. 
												"Practical statistics for data scientists" is well written and easy to work through. 
												"Introductory Business Statistics" repeated many of the same concepts with the focus mainly on practical exercises which I didn't find time to do in week 1. 
												"Basic Business Statistics: Concepts and Applications" was not available from the university online library so was not covered. 
												Finally, the data activities 1.1 and 1.2 were simple, giving a nice, gentle introduction to using R.
											<ul class="actions">
												<li><a href="Modules/Module3/Data Activities.html#Data-Activity-1" class="button">Data Activity 1</a></li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											<p>Unit 2 lecturecast on data structures in R was less engaging than the first. 
												The linked videos from Khan Academy were interesting and useful, although it wasn't clear how many were supposed to be watched because a new one would auto-start every each one finished. 
												I found scalars, vectors and matrices conceptually simply. 
												Adding, subtracting and multiplying matrices was also relatively straightforward, but inverting matrices was not! 
												Back to the lecturecast, the worked examples in R lacked any explanation as to why certain commands were being used, and without reference (yet) to any R coding books it was a little challenging to work out how commands were constructed, even though they were quite simple. 
												Starting with an overview of basic R commands would've been easier. 
												The reading was OK, especially as I had inadvertantly read what was needed in unit 2 from "Practical statistics for data scientists" in unit 1, although this week I made time to try some examples in RStudio. 
												Data activity 2 was quite simple again. It was useful to see how factor variables can make results more readable, but I'm not clear on how the factors are set in the first place. 
											<ul class="actions">
												<li><a href="Modules/Module3/Data Activities.html#Data-Activity-2" class="button">Data Activity 2</a></li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											<p>Unit 3 lecturecast was again quite weak. 
												It started with an overly basic video explaining file types and extension that could've just been a quick bit of text, but then skipped over how to examine datasets and variables with very little context. 
												I answered the quiz with 100% but still don't feel like I learned much. 
												This was underlined when reading "R you ready? Using the R program for statistical analysis and graphics" in which I struggled to follow the commands, and they didn't all work on my local installation of R or the Codio verion either. 
												I need an "overview of R" reference. 
												The seminar was interesting. 
												It was good to meet Russell, who was reassuring about the difficulty of the module, and the seminar was more interactive than the previous module, which made it more worthwhile. 
												Finally, the 100 Numpy exercises were difficult with limited experience with Python and none in Numpy. 
												I ended up just running through the answers, which was somewhat useful but probably not what was intended. 
												I started experimenting with R this week in readiness for the Statistical Analysis Presentation due in unit 12. 
												Data activity 3 was once again very simple, but useful to see real applications of simple tasks in R. In this case creating a subset of data, which will certainly be ueful. 
											<ul class="actions">
												<li><a href="Modules/Module3/Data Activities.html#Data-Activity-3" class="button">Data Activity 3</a></li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											<p>Unit 4 lecuturecast was better. The introduction to probabilities was basic, but covered useful simple notation. 
												The second half discussing the formulae for binomial, poisson and hypergeometric distributions was more difficult, and I won't remember the formulae, but it was still a good overview.
												Similarly, the online simulations of discrete probability distributions (binomial, poisson and hypergeometric) and continuous probability distributions (normal, uniform, exponential and gaussian) were interesting but I didn't really understand what they were telling me so I will need to revist later whenI have learned more of the context. 
												Chapter 3 of "Introductory Business Statistics" gave a good overview of probabilities, and whilst I conly did a selection of the exercises, they were very useful to cement the learning. 
											</p>
											<p>Unit 5 had no lecurecast.
												The reading built upopn previous topics covered in earlier reading and videos so it wasn't too taxing this week. I mainly skimmed through it because there was more practical work to focus on.
												The practical work centred around the collaborative discussion set for this week. A table in a medical journal paper had to be presented in a more reader friendly way by using plots. 
												It took a lot of experimentation and help from Google to eventually plot a stacked bar chart using ggplot in R. The results were posted in the discussion forum as shown in the Initial Post link on this page. It was interesting to see that Astrid took an almost identical approach, although the result was formatted slightly differently. 
												ggplot is a powerful tool that can produce results quite quickly and simply, but it can become complicated when more than just basic presentation is needed.
												In fact I'm finding that's true of R in general. It's quick to pick-up and do basic things, but it has powerful functions available to those prepared to learn and exploit them. 
												I did the seminar preparation after my discussion post. The seminar preparation included a video about ggplot which was very insightful. After doing the discussion exercise by trial and error I feel that I understand ggplot much more after watching the video. 
												Data activity 4 required creating a boxplot and barplot which is starting to demonstrate some of the visual cpabilities of R.

												<li><a href="Modules/Module3/Data Activities.html#Data-Activity-4" class="button">Data Activity 4</a></li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											<p>Unit 6 had a lot of reading covering confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, statsitical significance and p values. 
												There was a lot to read and I didn't have enough time to do it all thoroughly. However, the supplementary videos from Khan Academy were very useful and covered the topics well. 
												The statistics quiz wasn't particularly helpful. The questions were very simplistic and sometimes worded ambiguously leading to an incorrect answer when I knew what was meant by the correct answer. I don't feel that this has prepared me for the exam (if that is what it was intended to do). 
												I commented on Astrid's post in the discussion forum and she commented on mine. Unfortunately we were the only two to contribute. The comments were useful to learn some alternative methods, as well as validating the approached that we each took, but input from a wider audience would've made it more useful. 
											</p>
											<p>Unit 7 reading covered t-tests and ANOVA. I understood the t-test quite easily. Data activity 5 in this unit applied it which was a useful way to cement the understanding. I understood ANOVA conceptually from the required reading, but I had to do some wider research online to fully understand how to derrive a p-value. 
												The exam was not as easy as expected. Having been told it should be possible to finish in 30 mins (with time limit of 60 minutes) I found that it took the entire 60 minutes and even then I wasn't completely happy with my answeres. 
												The topics were broadly the ones that we had studied, but the depth needed was greater than we were told in the seminars so I hope I've done enough. I'm confident that I've passed, but I feel I could've got a much better mark if not for some simple errors due to time constraints. 
												Data activity 5 was a little more in-depth than previous activities. We were required to calculate mean, median and mode of certain variables. Simple enough, except R doesn't have a standard mode function so I adapted a fucntion from the Internet to find multiple modes if applicable. 
												I also discovered the quantile function for finding the five-figure summary of a variable. I experimented by using both boxplot and ggplot geom_boxplot, and finally the t.test function was used to test for association between two groups.
												This is now feeling like useful application of R to answer real questions.

											</p>
											<p>Unit 8 introduced non-parametric testing. 
											The paper  "Biostatistics 102: Quantitative Data - Parametric& Non-parametric Tests" by Y H Chan was particulary useful; being insightful and easy to read. On the otherhand I got nothing from "Non-Paraetric Tests for Testing of Scale Parameters" by M Goyal and N Kumar because it was too full of numbers and formulae and didn't explain anything that I could understand.
											Having leartned more about non-parametric tests I went back to data activity 5 from unit and added a Mann-Whitney U test as a better option than the previous parametric t-test because the distributiuon was not normal. 
											Once again the data activity was very useful to bring to life non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test and the Krushal-Wallis test. 
											We also had a fairly simple scenario based exercise in the unit to compare efficiency improvements between three teams. I chose to use a one sample t-test.

											</ul>
											</p>
											<p>Unit 9 covered cross-tabulations and Chi-Square analysis. 
											The lecturecast made a welcome return this week. Although the lecturecasts tend to be quite basic, having had a few weeks without one I can see the value of providing an overall structure/direction for the week's learning.
											I found studing previous weeks without a lecurecast to kick-off was more difficult to pick out of the reading what we needed to take in. 
											Reading focused mainly on the Chi-Square Test which was fairly simple. The paper discussing the mis-use of statistical tools such as p-value and confidence intervals was also interesting, and discussed some of my own concerns such as a p-value falling just on one side or the other of a significance level. 
											The data activity this week was very simple. It was practically the same as in the lecturecast so mot much thinking was needed, but it was still useful to test out the learning practically.
											<ul class="actions">
												<li><a href="Modules/Module3/Data Activities.html#Data-Activity-7" class="button">Data Activity 7</a></li>
											</ul>
											</p>

											<p>Unit 10 covered correlation. 
											The lecturecast gave a useful overview. It was generally quite simple, with probably the easiest summary quiz so far. However, the example calculations were unecessary given they were not worked through. The demonstration of how to do regression analysis in Excel was a very nice inclusion though. 
											
											The data activity was a simple correlation test that was then visualised using a scatterplot. It was simple, but once agail useful to experiment. 
											<ul class="actions">
												<li><a href="Modules/Module3/Data Activities.html#Data-Activity-8" class="button">Data Activity 8</a></li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											<p>Unit 11 covered regression analysis. 
											There was no lecturecast this week. The reading was fairly straightforward, although the formulae were a little more complicated than previous units. As has been the case throughout the module, Practical Statistics for Data Scientists by Bruce et al has an excellent balance of theory and practical application. 
											The data activity was a simple regressiona analysis and interpretation of the findings.

												<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Seminar 1 introduced the module, although the module started before the seminar so we'd already started studying.
											<br>We shared introductions with the module tutor (Dr. Russell Kabir) and covered an overview of the assessments, z-test, variance, standard deviation and data types.</p>
											<p>Seminar 2 covered descriptive statistics such as central tendancy (mean, median, mode) and variability (range, interquartile range and standard deviation).
											<br>We also covered stem and leaf tables, frequency tables and how to interpret boxplots.</p>
											<p>Seminar 3 covered probabilities and p-values.
											<br>We also discussed readiness for the exam.</p>
											<p>Seminar 4, which unforunately I was unable to attend in person so I watched the recording, recapped p-values with emphasis on type 1 and type 2 errors.
											<br>It also covered correlation using a scatter plot and correlation coefficient.</p>
											<p>Seminar 5 discussed the second assessment; the statistical analysis presentation.
