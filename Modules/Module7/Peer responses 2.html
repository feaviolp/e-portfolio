<p><b><u>Dominic Lambert</u></b></p>

<p>Hi Dominic,</p>

<p>I was a little concerned that this discussion would end up
with everyone saying very similar things and not being much of a “discussion”.
So thanks for providing some points that I can disagree with <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Segoe UI Emoji",sans-serif'>&#128522;</p>

<p>I disagree that presenting information that promotes Whizzz
more favourably is justifiable just because it is correct. That’s not to say
this behaviour isn’t prevalent, as identified by Fraser et al. (2018) and cited
in my initial post (Feaviour, 2024). Sadly this is probably one reason why the
phrase “lies, damned lies, and statistics” is still so widely used. Suggesting
that Abi might advise Whizz to request the information in a specific way in
order to get the results that they want leans further into this unethical (in
my opinion) behaviour.</p>

<p>I agree that Abi must have concern for the reputation of
the organisation that he works for, so he needs to be careful about what he
reports, and how bluntly. But I suggest that the reputation of his organisation
would be better served by providing ethically sounds results rather than misrepresenting,
albeit positively, this one client. On that basis I do agree with your view
that Abi should provide all of the information, and there are limits as to his
accountability in what they then do with it.</p>

<p>I confess to having a chuckle at your final paragraph; “who
cares?”. I understand the sentiment, and I expect it was a little
tongue-in-cheek, but unsurprisingly, when taken at face value I disagree. The
brief said that the data might suggest that the cereal is potentially harmful.
That may, or may not, fall short of killing someone, but whatever the severity
of the harm, it would be in the public interest to know it. Even if it’s as
simple as being nutritionally questionable, given the challenge of growing
obesity (Baker, 2023) it is still important to present accurate and complete
findings, not just cherry pick the positives. Which is why the questions should
be agreed before the research, not created after to match the best results.</p>

<p>In any case, I enjoyed reading and responding to your post.</p>

<p>Hi Giuseppe,</p>

<p>I agree with most of what you have said so I won’t waste
time re-stating it.</p>

<p>The one area where we differ slightly is your suggestion
that Abi should “communicate his findings to the manufacturer, underlining the
ethical and legal ramifications of selective data representation”. The
principle is fine, but in the real work, where Abi is employed by an
organisation and the manufacturer is their client, I think they might take a
dim view of such overly blunt, almost accusational messages. The disclaimer in
the report seems like a good idea though, and would serve the same purpose, so personally
I would suggest stopping there.</p>
