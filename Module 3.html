												<h3>Reflections</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I approached this module with some trepidation given the long time since I studied anything mathematical. 
												It wasnâ€™t especially easy starting the module because the first seminar was after two weeks, so it was all reading/self-study to begin with.
											</p>
											<p>Unit 1 lecturecasts gave a good introduction to R along with introducting methods of statistical measurement. 
												Reading for Unit 1 was not too bad, and R seems to be a fairly simple language so far. 
												"Practical statistics for data scientists" is well written and easy to work through. 
												"Introductory Business Statistics" repeated many of the same concepts with the focus mainly on practical exercises which I didn't find time to do in week 1. 
												"Basic Business Statistics: Concepts and Applications" was not available from the university online library so was not covered. 
												Finally, the data activities were simple, giving a nice, gentle introduction to using R.
											</p>
											<p>Unit 2 lecturecast on data structures in R was less engaging than the first. 
												The linked videos from Khan Academy were interesting and useful, although it wasn't clear how many were supposed to be watched because a new one would auto-start every each one finished. 
												I found scalars, vectors and matrices conceptually simply. 
												Adding, subtracting and multiplying matrices was also relatively straightforward, but inverting matrices was not! 
												Back to the lecturecast, the worked examples in R lacked any explanation as to why certain commands were being used, and without reference (yet) to any R coding books it was a little challenging to work out how commands were constructed, even though they were quite simple. 
												Starting with an overview of basic R commands would've been easier. 
												The reading was OK, especially as I had inadvertantly read what was needed in unit 2 from "Practical statistics for data scientists" in unit 1, although this week I made time to try some examples in RStudio.
											</p>
											<p>Unit 3 lecturecast was again quite weak. 
												It started with an overly basic video explaining file types and extension that could've just been a quick bit of text, but then skipped over how to examine datasets and variables with very little context. 
												I answered the quiz with 100% but still don't feel like I learned much. 
												This was underlined when reading "R you ready? Using the R program for statistical analysis and graphics" in which I struggled to follow the commands, and they didn't all work on my local installation of R or the Codio verion either. 
												I need an "overview of R" reference. 
												The seminar was interesting. 
												It was good to meet Russell, who was reassuring about the difficulty of the module, and the seminar was more interactive than the previous module, which made it more worthwhile. 
												Finally, the 100 Numpy exercises were difficult with limited experience with Python and none in Numpy. 
												I ended up just running through the answers, which was somewhat useful but probably not what was intended. 
												I started experimenting with R this week in readiness for the Statistical Analysis Presentation due in unit 12. 
											</p>
											<p>Unit 4 lecuturecast was better. The introduction to probabilities was basic, but covered useful simple notation. 
												The second half discussing the formulae for binomial, poisson and hypergeometric distributions was more difficult, and I won't remember the formulae, but it was still a good overview.
												Similarly, the online simulations of discrete probability distributions (binomial, poisson and hypergeometric) and continuous probability distributions (normal, uniform, exponential and gaussian) were interesting but I didn't really understand what they were telling me so I will need to revist later whenI have learned more of the context. 
												Chapter 3 of "Introductory Business Statistics" gave a good overview of probabilities, and whilst I conly did a selection of the exercises, they were very useful to cement the learning.
