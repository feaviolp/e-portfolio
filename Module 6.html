												<h3>Reflections</h3>
											</header>
											<h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Agent-Based Computing</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast "Introduction to Agent-Based Computing" provided a good introduction to the subject area, including the relevence of agent-based computing in society. The speech on the videos was too fast to follow easily, and the final quiz had a question whose answer was clearly incorrect, but overall it was a good introductory lecturecast. 
												<br><br>The reading was only chapter 2 of the core book "An Introduction to Multiagent Systems" which continued the introduction to agents, including defining agents and describing reactive agents vs. agents with state. 
												<br><br>There was a collaborative discussion about what led to the rise of agent-based systems. I gave some examples within supply chain management, which was nice for me to reflect on outside of the discussion because I have worked in supply chain management before. My initial post can be found here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Initial post 1.html" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 2: Introducing First Order Logic</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Unit 2 covered First Order Logic. The reading was quite deep and the seminar, which unfortunately occured before I was able to complete the reading, was also very deep and I struggled to keep up. This is an area that I'm going to need to re-visit to become proficient. 
												Interestingly, Prolog was mentioned during the seminar, and I briefly used Prolog during my BSc studies (far too many years ago) so I hope that, given a little time and additional reading it will come back to me. 
												<br><br>This week also included commenting on other people's posts for the collaborative discussion. I commented on Astrid van Toor's post about different types of agents in traffic management, supply chain, and modelling climate change, and Samuel Adeniyi's post about the rise of agent-based systems due to the increasing complexity of modern business environments:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Peer responses 1.html" class="button">Peer Responses</a></li>
												</ul>
												The groups for the group project were announced this week too. I'm in a group with Astrid van Toor and Anastasia Rizzo which is good because I'm confident that we will work well together. 
												We had a kick-off call (meeting notes below) where we discussed the project in detail, which is about producing a design proposal for an agent based system. We decided to design an Online Academic Research tool and and agreed to each research agents further and forulate draft project requirements and a project plan so we can bring our ideas together next week to finalise the plan and allocate tasks. 
												We also agreed a team contract (link below). We have scheduled weekly checkpoint calls until the project finishes. 
												<br><br>

													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Project initiation.pdf" class="button">Project Initiation</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Team Contract.pdf" class="button">Team Contract</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 3: Agent Architectures</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast introduced agent architectures including deductive reasoning architecture, practical reasoning architecture and subsumption architecture. It's clear that the scope of intelligent agents is more broad than I had realised and there is much to be learned. 
												<br><br>We had a team call this week to discuss things that we needed to clarify about the team project, and then a call with the tutor to seek those clarification, which was very helpful. Notes from both meetings below:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Prep for tutor call.pdf" class="button">Prep for call with tutor</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Tutor clarification.pdf" class="button">Tutor clarifications</a></li>
												</ul>
												The reading was various papers describing different approaches for agent architecture. Some of the reading was quite deep, and I don’t profess to fully understanding it all, but it’s clear that there are different ways to represent how to design and build agent based systems. 
												In fact one thing that struck me was how Maes (1991) talks about modules within an agent in the same way that others talk about individual agents in a multi-agent system. There doesn’t appear to be a universal definition of the “size” of an agent, let along how to “connect” then in a standardised architecture. 
												<br><br>Finally, I submitted my summary post for the collaborative discussion:
												<br><br>

												</ul>

											</p>
											<h3>Unit 4: Hybrid Agent Architectures</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Following the project team call and tutor clarification call last week I looked further into how to diagramatically represent agent system designs and I found an Agent UML (AUML) proposed by Bauer et at (2001). This looked like an excellent way to take the UML sequence diagram that I had already drafted and make a few small changes to better illustrate the agent architecture. 
												I have drafted a new version following the AUML guidelines and sent to the team for review on Friday's checkpoint call. The diagram has also raised a few important design points that need to be agreed so we'll discuss those on Friday too. 
												<br><br>We held the first checkpoint call where key design issues were discussed and decisions made. We have a few more actions to complete before we can finish the design proposal. 
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 1.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 1</a></li>
												</ul>
												The seminar and reading for this week both focused on hybrid agent architectures. It was interesting to see different agent architecures and it helped to answer a question that I been pondering about at what point an agent can be considered to be an "intelligent agent". 
												It seems that our project design is utilising one of the simplest agent architectures; the reactive "subsumption architecure" (Brooks, 1991), whereby situations produce actions without reasoning.

												<br>Brooks, R.A. (1991) Intelligence without representation. <i>Artificial intelligence</i>, 47(1-3): 139-159.
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 5: Agent Communication</h3>
											<p>
												<br>This lecturecast was very different to others on the course so far, starting with a discussion about the semantics of speech before briefly covering the agent based communication language KQML, which will be covered in more detail in later reading. 
												Frustratingly, once again the quiz required an incorrect answer on order to achieve 100%. 
												<br><br>The reading this week was extremely verbose. Searle (1969) went to great lengths to effectively decompose langage into "speech acts" which are individual tokens of information that vary depending upon context. 
												The simplicity of my summary compared to the length of the book serves to illustrate the challenge, in that the book attempts to codify natural language, which relies upon a general understanding of contexct and meaning between the person speaking and the person being spoken to. It turns out that codifying it is incredibly complicated! 
												<br><br>This is brought back to the topic of agents with Payne and Tamma (2014) who propose a method for agents to negotiate with each other when their ontologies and goals differ. This is something that I hadn't really thought about before, thinking that agents simply pass requests and responses back and forth, but in a true multi-agent system where agents are independent with different goals, a way to negotiate as well as just send instructions and responses does seem necessary. Food for thought here.  
												<br><br>Unfortunately Anastasia decided to leave our project group this week for personal reasons and join another group. We are almost ready to submit the project and it's been almost entirely Astrid's and my work to date anyway so this shouldn't pose any problems for us.
												<br><br>Finally, another collaborative discussion started this week about the advantages and disadvantages of the agent communication language (ACL) Knowledge Query and Manipulation language (KQML). My initial post is here:

											</p>
											<h3>Unit 6: Working Together</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The reading this week was much simpler, which was a refreshing change from last week. It was even easier because, by coincidence, I had already read Finin et al (1994) last week for the collaborative discussion. 
												<br><br>I commented on Vasilisa Lukashevich and Alberto Castro's posts in the collaborative dsicussion with similar comments in both, which was to say that I felt their descriptions of multi-agent systems when describing Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) were more like distributed systems than genuine multi-agent systems with fuly autonomous agents, so KQML would be less useful anyway:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Peer responses 2.html" class="button">Peer Responses</a></li>
												</ul>
												There was a formative activity to create a simple agent dialogue in KQML and KIF between two agents. I don't think it's exactly right, but my answer is here:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Agent Dialogue.html" class="button">Agent Dialogue</a></li>
												</ul>
												Astrid and I completed and submitted the team project design proposal document:

											</p>
											<h3>Unit 7: Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast about Natural Language Processing was interesting, showing how words are associated with each other using three dimensional vectors. The complexities of language, with words that have multiple meanings and situational context etc. make this a challenging and interesting topic. 
												<br><br>The reading covered word representation and handwriting recognition using artificial neural networks (ANNs), which was a topical overlap with the machine learning module where we're currently also studying ANNs.
												<br><br>Having submitted project 1 last week we held an initiation meeting for project 2:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Project 2 initiation.pdf" class="button">Project 2 Initiation</a></li>
												</ul>
												This week concluded the collaborative discussion about Agent Communication Languages. My summary post is here: 
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Summary post 2.html" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 8: Understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The seminar this week was about Natural Language Processing (NLP). It was interesting to learn about word embedding, which is vector representations of words in context, which can be frequency based or prediction based. 
												We also discussed pre-processing of text, such as removing HTML tags, tokenising words, and removing stop words such as "and", "is", "an" etc., which make sentences easier to read for humans but just adds noise for NLP. 
												<br><br>The reading discussed parse trees which is about how words are linked within sentences, used in NLP. There was also a formative activity to create parse trees for three simple sentences. I completed the exercise by modifying the Python code presented in the reading, which was another good opportunity to practice Python: 
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/parse_trees.html" class="button">Parse Trees</a></li>
												</ul>
												We also held our first checkpoint call for the second team project:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 2 1.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 1</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 9: Introduction to Adaptive Algorithms</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast covered Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
												We've just learned about ANNs and CNNs in the Machine Learning module, so once again the modules are overlapping but it's good to see different perspectives on the same topics, which is helpful to contextualise the learning. I have to say that the Machine Learning lecturecast was easier to follow though so I'm glad that I saw that one first. 
												It was also interesting to hear about RNNs, which was a new topic. 
												<br><br>The "reading" was a Forbes article and two videos. The article was a strangely written but quite insightlful review (albeit 8 years old) about the motivations of AI, using Microsoft's deep learning outperforming a human in image recognition as the hook. 
												The videos were lecures by Andrew Ng on deep learning. Some of the content had already been covered in the CNN material from the Machine Learning module, but the lectures went into more details about how the algorithms work conceptually rather than just mathematically. This is much more closely aligned with my preferred learning style so I was pleased with the recap. 
												The sparse coding looking for edge angles in images rather than individual pixels, and similar features in sound and touch was very clever. I wonder if sparse coding could outperform CNNs? I also liked the quote "it's not who has the best algorithm that wins, it's who has the most data". This is a simple and meaningful soundbite that I think I will remember and apply. 
												<br><br>Another collaborative discussion started this week about ethical implications of generative AI. My initial post is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Initial post 3.html" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>	
												The team project is going very well, having started it during the first project. We had our second checkpoint call:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 2 2.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 2</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 10: Deep Learning in Action</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The core reading this week was how deep learning can improve productivity and boost business, from the world economic forum. It was quite high level, and suprising how little the risks were mentioned, although not omitted altogether. 
												There was also self-directed reading about deep learning, ChatGPT, OpenAI etc. I discovered very little that I hadn't already read, which I suppose means my previous research was good?!? 
												<br><br>I responded to two posts in the discussion forum. One to Astrid van Toor about artisitc styles being plagiarised by generative AI, and the other to Samuel Adeniyi (including Astrid again) about the pitfalls of trying to control generative AI with guardrails, albeit necessary, and how that might have implications on free speech and create it's own kind of social engineering if implemented carelessly:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Peer responses 3.html" class="button">Peer Responses</a></li>
												</ul>
												We had a project checkpoint call where we discussed finalising the code and started to think about how it will be presented:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 2 3.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 3</a></li>
												</ul>
												We also had a formative activity to discuss a practical application of deep learning:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Deep learning.html" class="button">Deep Learning</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 11: Intelligent Agents in Action</h3>
											<p>
												We had our final checkpoint call for the team project. We've made excellent progress and just need to complete the recording of the presentation to submit on Monday:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 2 4.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 4</a></li>
												</ul>
												<br>The lecturecast and reading this week covered real life applications for intelligent agents, which was interesting and aligns with my preferred learing style of practical application rather than just theory. I've come across digital twins in my work previously alongside IoT, and we've discussed intelligent supply chains and Dall-E in the collaborative discussions already. 
												I also noted the problem of deadlocks in an easlier collaborative discussion, which was also discussed in one of the papers with a proposed solution being a coordinator agent, so it was interesting to see alternative views on that previous topic too. It feels like this week brought a lot of the earlier content together into a cohesive context, which was really good. 
												It's always interesting, for me at least, to look at real-world applications for the academic topics that we're learning about. DopeLearning was funny though - I thought it was a spelling mistake for Deep Learning until I read further that it was a tool to generate rap lyrics. I'm left wondering how, or even if, they deal with profanities since they are often prevalent in rap lyrics. 
												<br><br>I submittted my summary post for the collaborative discussion about ethical implications of generative AI, under the title of Deep Learning:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Summary post 3.html" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>	
												We also submitted our team project presentation, which we're very pleased with. The submission included a video recording of the presentation plus the slides and transcript, the source code and executable files. The slides are here:
												<br><br>

													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Academic Paper Search Application Presentation.pdf" class="button">Academic Paper Search Application Presentation</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 12: The Future of Intelligent Agents</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Unit 12 looked at the future of intelligent agents. The reading was lighter in this final unit, which was welcome because the individual reflection also had to be written this week and I hadn't started it early due to completing the team project in unit 11. 
												It was still a useful read, about artificial intelligence incidents and ethics. Much was reinforcement of what had already been covered, but one comment about autonomous drone swarms being a weapon of mass destruction struck a chord with me given the current war in Ukraine and the way that both Russia and Ukraine are adapting their weapons for strategic advantage, as well as due to supply issues of conventional weapons. 
												<br><br>The final seminar covered the e-portfolio and individual reflection, and as per the reading, the future of intelligent agents. I have been keeping my e-portfolio updated each week so that part is practically done, but I am struggling a little with the individual reflection because it's not the way that I typically think. I am starting it now. 
												The "discussion" on the future of intelligent agents (not really a discussion because unfortunately no-one was able to atend in person so I listened to the recording) was short but thought provoking. We already know that AI, and by extension intelligent agents, are a hot topic in the media at the moment. 
												However, two things really stuck out for me in the seminar; that work is underway to tune AI responses to make them feel more trustworky and make people feel more comfortable with them, and the idea of intelligent agents becoming lifeling companions through continuous learning. 
												I took from the first point that it was important for AI to FEEL more trustworrth, not necessarily to BE more trustworth, which leading into AI becoming a lifeling companion starts to bring to mind thoughts of distopian science fiction. I realise that the lifelong companion can simply be a Netflix recommender that knows what I want to watch before I do, but the direction of travel is still one to be very mindful of. 
												I still believe that AI, including intelligent agents, can be a force for good, However there are many eithical risks that remain, with bad actors always waiting to take advantage. The industry must remain vigilant.
