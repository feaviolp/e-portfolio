<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>An interesting read Astrid. It’s clear that streaming
services rely heavily on AI, which is probably why so many of us mentioned them
in our own discussion posts.</span></p>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0cm'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You mentioned that techniques such
as Collaborative filtering, used by Spotify, rely on longer term interactions
and so new users don’t immediately benefit from them. I’m interested to know
how Spotify and other streaming services therefore provide recommendations to
brand new customers? Also, how quickly do they learn so the personalisation through
Collaborative filtering kicks-in? Finally, is there an accepted timeframe,
measured in elapsed time or perhaps number of interactions, within which a
system should be sufficiently personalised in order to minimise the risk of the
customer losing interest and moving elsewhere?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Hi Astrid,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Thanks for the details about the Heater method from Zhu et
al (2021). It looks like an improvement in dealing with cold start issues, and
seems to be especially useful in the case of cold user AND cold content (how to
get content that is new to the system to right person who is also new to the
system). I don’t think anyone is using the Heater method yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Burke (2002) examines five recommendation techniques
including collaborative filtering and knowledge-based. The latter relies on content
being catalogued, which overcomes the cold start issues but at the expense of
being less accurate and presumably labour intensive to classify all new
content, so a hybrid model is recommended using multiple methods, which
actually aligns with Zhu et al (2020) saying that methods other their Heater
method use auxiliary information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Netflix tries to get around the cold user issue by asking new
users what they like to watch to effectively “jump start the recommendation
system” (Netflix, N.D.). They also have the “New on Netflix” carousel which I
suppose helps to get around the cold content issue by making it available to
everyone, and then as people start to interact, or not, with new content the
collaborative filtering kicks-in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

recommendations because of viewing restrictions in different regions. I would
argue that the content is simply not available in those regions, so the
algorithm isn’t biased as such, it’s simply operating with a reduced choice. Possibly
semantics, but I think not. That’s not to say that the recommendation system
isn’t biased in other ways though, nor to say that having bias doesn’t have
potentially serious consequences. I simply challenge that one use case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>News vs. fake news is another very interesting area. I
agree with your findings, and would even go further to cite the deepfake video
of president Zelensky that was posted to try to convince Ukrainian troops to
surrender (Simonite, 2022), where the surprising part was how poorly executed
the video was. I would also suggest that fake news is not just created by the
obvious “bad actors”, but to some degree by all governments, keen as they are
to have their view of the world accepted by their populations. I suspect that’s
what you were driving at with your comment “despite there being an accord from 193
out of 199 countries we still have a problem”.</span></p>

that the imaging software would definitely speed-up the process and reduce
errors, but since the algorithm is only looking at images I suggest that there’s
nothing that the AI could identify that an expert, given time, wouldn’t be able
to identify for themself.</span></p>

can avoid [bias] by ensuring ethical practice committees are in place as part

it’s dangerous for any organisation, private or public, to convince itself that
bias has been entirely avoided through the use of standards and processes. As
you point out, any system based on data has the potential to develop bias, so
we must remain vigilant to the risks and be ready to take action as needed when
bias is detected. In other words a healthy mix of prevent and react.</span></p>

intended, and yet it’s systemically unethical because it’s having undesirable
effects elsewhere in the ecosystem. </span></p>

about the use of AI in FinTech Max. It’s clear to see that AI is helping to
reduce fraud and speed-up decisions. Do you see any downsides though? Perhaps
any ethical challenges or financial risks? I would expect that an AI system
that’s responsible for saving vast sums of money also has the potential to lose
vast sums of money if it goes wrong. Or what about in the case of fraud
prevention, if it gets a bit too protective and prevents legitimate
transactions thinking they were fraudulent which resulted in a threat to
someone’s safety because they couldn’t buy a train ticket to get home? As the
power of AI increases it can be tempting to just ramp it up “because we can”.
However, as the last example illustrates, we need to keep in mind the consequences,
so we should be super careful about preventing large scale fraud, with a low
risk tolerance for large values, but probably have a higher tolerance for lower
values so we don’t stop someone getting a train ticket home in case an
erroneous fraud flag gets triggered.</span></p>

ubiquitous. I think it depends upon how literally we take the definition of
ubiquitous. For me it means that something exists everywhere, or at least most
places, in some form. Yes, “most places” does not strictly match the definition
of “everywhere”, but I think when it comes to something that this question it
will never be “everywhere”, so it’s more about being pervasive, or widespread.
I say “in some form” because I believe that even immature applications of AI
add to the ubiquity. I accept that you’ll disagree here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Your life sciences examples of AI are very
interesting, and of course topical regarding Covid-19. It’s a very valid and
incredibly important point to make about the sharing of data to enable future
research which benefits health. Of course pharmaceutical companies make obscene
amounts of money by protecting their intellectual property, which is usually
the result of significant investment, so it’s always going to be an ethical
dilemma about how much to share for the benefit of humanity versus how much not
to share to protect their own profits.&nbsp;</span></p>
