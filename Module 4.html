												<h3>Reflections</h3>
											</header>
											<h3>Unit 1</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast "Introduction to Machine Learning" provided a really good introduction to many different topics to be covered in the module. This had the greatest depth of information of any lecturecast so far, and it was only the introduction. The videos were well paced and it has certainly made me curious about the rest of the module. 
												<br><br>The first sub-chapter of the core book "An Introduction to Machine Learning" introducted why machine learning is needed without yet getting into the complexities of how to implement it while the online reading gave a bit of history of machine learning. 
												There was a paper on correlation and regression that described some statistics used in machine learning, and whilst I understood the concepts I didn't attempt to work through the equations. 
												Finally, the paper "Deep Learning in Social Computing" gave an interesting insight into social science and computer science come trogehter. It did, however, remind me of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the ethical considerations of using technology for social engineering. 
												<br><br>There was a collaborative discussion about the impact of industry 4.0. I used the example of Boeing 737 MAX where the reckless use of technology caused two plane crashes. My initial post can be found here: 
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Initial post 1.htm" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 2</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The reading for unit 2 was very short and simple, covering the concepts of machine learning. That was luck because the activities this week were very time consuming. 
												<br><br>Exploratory Data Analysis was performed in Python using a provided Jupyter notebook on a sample dataset, in this case relating to house prices. The code was then to be modified to analyse a different dataset concerning miles per gallon of different cars. 
												The chalenge was I didn't have Python, and IDE or Jupyter notebook installed. I tried installing them on my work laptop with limited success due to security policies in place, so I switched to my personal laptop. Here I managed to get them installed, using Pycharm as the IDE after trying unsuccessfully to get Visual Studio Code to work with the correct Python interpreter, but even with the sample code I faced many errors and warnings. After a very long time fault finding I eventually got it to work, albeit with some warnings remaining. 
												Incidentally there were still errors and warnings when running on the Codio environement provided by Essex university, so it seems that the provided code includes some depricated functionality. When I finally got it all working there were some very useful features in the analysis. 
												I'd like to put on record my thanks to  Astrid van Toor for helping me to setup Pycharm when I was facing issues due to having had so many attemtmps with remnants of Python versions including and excluding Anaconda. 
												The executed Jupyter notebooks for both the tutorial and the modified dataset are here: 
												<ul class="actions">

													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Unit02 Data Analysis - auto-mpg.html" class="button">EDA on auto-mpg</a></li>
												</ul>
												This week also included commenting on other people's posts for the collaborative discussion. I commented on Samuel Adeniyi's post about the 2019 Captial One data breach and Astrid van Toor's post about the 2022 LastPass data breach. 
												<br><br>The groups for the group project were agreed this week. I'm in a group with Astrid van Toor and Anastasia Rizzo. We had a project initialtion call (notes below) where we discussed the project in detail, which is about using an AirBnB data set to pose a question, the answer to which would be useful to AirBnB executives, and then use data analysis to answer the question ina short report. We held a kick-off call where we agreed on a draft question. 
												We agreed to each perform an initial Exploratory Data Analysis which we will each present and discuss at the next meeting. We also agreed a team contract (link below). We have weekly checkpoint meetings scheduled until the project finishes.

												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 3</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The seminars appear to be offset by one week in this module, so the unit 2 seminar was in week 3. No matter, I will report them in the week that they happened. 
												The seminar covered Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It was interesting and covered a lot of the topics that we'd already learned in doing the EDA activity so it was a useful to cement the learning. It was also clear that the tutor, Nadeem, was knowledgealbe and passionate about the subject which is a good sign. 
												<br><br>For the team project I performed an initial EDA on the dataset to discuss with the rest of the team. We also had our first weekly checkpoint call:

													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 1.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 1</a></li>
												</ul>
												I also submitted my summary post for the collaborative discussion:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Summary post 1.htm" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>
												The lecturecast on correlation and regression was the best so far in any module. The worked example on how to calculate simple linear regression using the least square method explained teh steps very clearly was the simplest explanation I've seen. 
												The videos on logistic regression and decision tree were also clearly structed and well paced with simple worked examples in Python using sklearn. 
												<br><br>The was relatively short but also out of context. We were given two sections to read from the core book "An Introduction to Machine Learning, but the sections, on performance of K-Nearerst Neighbor and Perceptron Learning, didn't make sense on their own so I read more from the chapters that they came from to try to understand them better. 
												<br><br>There were also formative activities on correlation and regression. Variables in provided Jupyter notebooks (below) were edited to observe results. It was an interesting exercise, especially making some small corrections to one of the files to make it work, but not much was really learned. 
												Also, one of the files needed a cars.csv dataset that wasn't provided so I had to find it on Kaggle, and two had graphs that were actually images copied from a previous run of the code, so when values were changed the graph was static so no longer aligned with the data. It took me a moment to realise why the graphs no longer aligned!

												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 4</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Following last week's project checkpoing call and a subsequent discussion in the WhatsApp group I reflected on how to remove outliers from the data and sent a proposal to the group as an EDA addendum. After that I experimented with DBSCAN for clustering building on clustering that Astrid had already done using K-Means and K-Prototype:

													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Airbnb dbscan.html" class="button">Airbnb DBSCAN</a></li>
												</ul>
												We had another checkpoint call to discuss project progress and next steps:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 2.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 2</a></li>
												</ul>
												There was a lot of work this week on the team project, but fortunately the reading was relatively light, just introducing polynomial classifiers.
												<br><br>Finally, there were some fairly lengthy formative exercises to prepare for the seminar on linear regression. First a demo Jupyter notebood was run through to demonstrate correlation and regression of fuel consumption with other features.  
												Next similar activities were worked though using population and GDP from two different datasets, which meant a bit more up-front data manipulation to clean and combine the datasets before even starting on correlation and regression. It was challenging and I'm not sure I got it completely right:
												<br><br>

													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Correlation and regression.html" class="button">Worked correlation & regression</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>								
											<h3>Unit 5</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The topic of unit 5 was clustering, but the reading in the core book referred to multilayer perceptrons in artificial neural networks. This didn't seem right so I looked ahead at other unit and the seems to be a misalignment in most of the units. I have flagged this to the tutor in order to rectivy the reading list in teh VLE, but in teh meantime I read teh chapter on clustering rather than the one instructed in order to remain relevant. 
												<br><br>This week also had a seminar on clustering which was useful, although it didn't really cover any new ground.
												<br><br>One really useful piece of learning this week was a short animation provided describing how k-mean clustering works. I found it really useful to step away from the mathematics and just watch a visualisation of the repetitive approach to re-assigning nodes to clusters until teh optimal clusters have been found.
												<br><br>Unfortunately Anastasia decided to leave our project group this week for personal reasons and join another group. Panagiotis Koilakos has been assigned to our group as a replacement, so we held an interim checkpoint call to bring him up-to-speed and agree how we can work together to complete the project given it's less than two weeks until the deadline. Panagiotis seems keen so I think we'll work together harmoniously to complete the project. 
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 3.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 3</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 6</h3>
											<p>
												<br>We started this week with another project checkpoint call to catch-up with what we'd all been doing over the weekend and agree actions to complete the report because the deadline is only one week away. 
												We kept in touch throughout the week over WhatsApp and email to complete the report, which was then submitted:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 4.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 4</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Airbnb business analysis report.pdf" class="button">Airbnb business analysis report</a></li>													
												</ul>
												There was no new reading this week, instead re-capping clustering from last week. 
												<br><br>There were activitied on k-means clustering which we completed as a team: 
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/K-means demo.html" class="button">K-means demo</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/K-means iris.html" class="button">K-means Iris</a></li>

													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/K-means weather.html" class="button">K-means Weather</a></li>
												</ul>
												At the end of the week we submitted our team project materials:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Exploratory Data Analysis - AirBnB.html" class="button">Initial EDA</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Airbnb EDA addendum.html" class="button">EDA Addendum (outlier removal)</a></li>
												</ul>

													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Airbnb business analysis report.pdf" class="button">Airbnb business analysis report</a></li>													
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 7</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The seminar was on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which will be requried for the second team project. I wasn't able to attend this one in-person so I had to wait to watch the recording. 
												It was an excellent seminar giving a brilliant overview of ANNs and how to implement them in Python. This will surely be useful for the project ahead.
												<br><br>We held a project initiation call for the second project, but we the seminar recording hadn't been published when we held the call so the scope of what we could cover was limited:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Project 2 initiation.pdf" class="button">Project 2 Initiation</a></li>
												</ul>
												The lecturecast was also about ANNs covering three topics; perceptrons, adjusting the weights of a single perceptron to create an AND operator, and using multi-layer perceptrons to crease an XOR operator.
												It was a much more interactive lecturecast, with a formative exercise to complete after each topic to cement the learning. 
												This was a good way to understand what was being taught in a practical sense. The code, especially the multilayer perceptrons, was quite complicated and needed to be read through a few times, but even though the exercises were just running through existing jupyter notebooks, it still make it more "real" and easier to understand. I liked it. 
												The results are here: 
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/simple_perceptron.html" class="button">simple perceptron</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/perceptron_AND_operator.html" class="button">perceptron AND operator</a></li>												
												</ul>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/multi-layer Perceptron.html" class="button">multi-layer Perceptron</a></li>												
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 8</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast covered backpropogation in neural networks, showing how the weights and bias of each neuron is adjusted with every epoch to reduce error (increase accuracy). It was useful to know how it works, but in reality that's all handled by the appropriate function e.g. TensorFlow and Keras. 
												So understanding the precise mathematics isn't necessary for practical implementation, however understanding the principles are important because the selected activation function contains the derivative, and hence how the back propogation will be done. 
												<br><br>The reading covered a range of real-life applications, opportuities and challenges of machine learning, which was a nice way to keep the theoretical learning grounded in practicality, as well as furthe details on backpropogation. 
												<br><br>We've been making excellent progress on the second team project over the past week, working independently and communicating over email and WhatsApp. We got together for a checkpoint call on Friday and then again on Monday:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 2 1.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 1</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 2 2.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 2</a></li>
												</ul>
												There was also a new collaborative discussion this week about the benefits and risks of AI writers. My initial post is here: 
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Initial post 2.htm" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>
												Finally, there was an activity to run and modify a Jupyter notebook examining the gradient descent cost function (part of backpropogation):
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/gradient_descent_cost_function.html" class="button">Gradient cost function</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 9</h3>
											<p>
												<br>There was another very good seminar this week, about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I've already been experimenting with CNNs for the team project, but I've been changing parameters without rteally understanding why. 
												The seminar gave an excellent overview. I now fully understand how the convolutional and pooling layers work now so I can continue to improve the model with a more focused approach.
												<br><br>The lecturecast on CNNs wasn't bad, but I watched it after the seminar and the lecturecast was more basic so I don't feel that I learned anything new. 
												<br><br>The reading covered CNNs, which was good to embed the knowledge from the seminar, and ethical issues with facial recognisition, which was a timely reminder about the pitfalls of the use of AI in society. 
												<br><br>I responded to two posts in the collaborative discussion. I discussed the need to reform and modernise education to work with tools such as GPT instead of just trying to address the risks of cheating, with Astrid van Toor, and the issue of content ownershp and patents for generated content with Samuel Adeniyi. 
												<br><br>The formative activity was to run a Jupyter notebook with a CNN model and adjust parameters to see the effects. Firstly, some of the functionality in the notebook has been deprecated so I had to edit the code to make it work. 
												And then it had quite poor accuracy. The model that we're developing for the team project is already much better, which gives me some confidence for the project work. In any case, the results are here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/gradient_descent_cost_function.html" class="button">Gradient cost function</a></li>
												</ul>
												The team project is coming along nicely. The ANN and CNN models are pretty much complete so on the checkpoint call we turned out attention to the presentation:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 2 3.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 3</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 10</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The reading went into further depth on CNNs, although with the reading and project work so far I'm pretty comfortable with the CNN theory now. The CNN Explainer site was a useful visualisation of a CNN in action though, so that was good. 
												<br><br>We had three project checkpoint calls to review progress on the presentation, finalise the running order and timings, and then finally to review and confirm artefacts for submission: 
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 2 4.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 4</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 2 5.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 5</a></li>
												</ul>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 2 6.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 6</a></li>
												</ul>
												I submitted my summary post for the second collaborative discussion: 
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Summary post 2.htm" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 11</h3>
											<p>
												<br>We finished recording our group project presentation amd submitted a week early. We're all very pleased with the results. A copy of the presentation slide pack is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/ANN_58_percent.html" class="button">ANN with 58% Accuracy</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/CNN_82_percent.html" class="button">CNN with 82% accuracy</a></li>
												</ul>	
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Neural network object recognition presentation.pdf" class="button">Neural network object recognition presentation</a></li>
												</ul>
												There was a seminar on model evaluation which was also the topic of this week's lecturecast and reading. Most of the information we'd already learned for the team project.
												<br><br>Finally, there was a formative activity about model performance measurement to observe changes in AUC and R2 error in a Jupyter notebook file. 
												This was interesting, and I should note that in our project presentation we didn't include AUC or R2, instead using simple accuracy and a confusion matrix to present our results. 
												I trust this will be OK because there are multiple ways to present model performance, and early in the project we were specifically told to focus on accuracy. The initial file is here:
