<p><b><u>Dominic Lambert</u></b></p>

<p>Hi Dominic,</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading your post, with your insights from having
worked in the defence industry. It’s easy to take case studies such as this at
face value, but your critique backed by real-world experience was insightful
and thought provoking.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the engineers were culpable,
potentially criminally, by breaking non-disclosure agreements. Having a
conflict of ethics with Q Industries and deciding to resign as a result is
fine, but breaching the non-disclosure agreement is not. Particularly
disturbing from the case study: “the engineers were right to foster public
awareness of these risks, and breaking their confidentiality agreements would
be ethically justified.” (Association for Computing Machinery, N.D.). Ethically
justified perhaps, but it’s a dangerous statement to say that they were “right”
without evidence of unlawful behaviour, of which there is none.</p>

<p>However, returning to the exercise, it is clear that Q
Industries were in breach of many ACM principles, and given the nature of their
business, that must be a concern. I accept that they have not, as far as we can
see, broken any laws. I also accept that ACM and BCS carry no legislative
weight. But I do still think that the assessment against the ACM principles is
a worthwhile exercise to bring to life some of the principles. To your own
point about the lack of sufficient legislation for ethical violations, would it
not be the case that assessing compliance against non-binding codes of conduct
at least sets a benchmark, albeit unenforceable, which is a start?</p>

<p>Hi Alberto,</p>

<p>I think we can all agree with your conclusion that “dark UX
is a bad practice that violates several ethical principles”. What I find
interesting about this particular case study, however, is the accountability of
the client versus the development agency versus the developer. The client is
clearly being unethical with their request. In fact the level of bad practice
is almost comically bad in order to make the point, and you highlight some in
your post. However, the case study analysis suggests that it is the developer
wo is at fault, such as “computing professionals have a moral obligation to use
their skills to benefit the members of society (Principle 1.1)” (Association
for Computing Machinery, N.D.). I agree that in this case the developer clearly
contravened that principle, and we have seen that they already had reservations
and raised them to his manager (does that make him more ethical or more
complicit?). </p>

<p>My question is, should the development agency be held
accountable for failing to adhere to the principles? I believe so, especially
in light of the concerns being raised from within their own organisation. Then,
should the developer, Simon, similarly be held accountable? According to the
principles the answer is clearly “yes”, and from your post I think you feel the
same, but in the real world I can understand a developer smelling that
something isn’t right, raising it this manager, being told to do it anyway, and
so getting on and doing as he is told. It’s a job after all, and one that is
paying his bills. Controversial perhaps, but something to ponder….</p>

<p><b><u>Dominic Lambert in reply to Leigh Feaviour</u></b></p>

<p>Hi Dominic,</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I agree that the discussion is more
interesting when focused on the points of disagreement.</p>

<p>You make a valid and timely point that ACM and BCS lack “legislative
teeth” in that they are codes of conduct that are not legally binding. I
started by stating that Blocker Plus is compliant with US federal regulations,
and much of the rest of my post detailed failures to comply with ACM and BCS,
so it could be assumed that the difference is implied, but I completely agree
that I was not clear. </p>

<p>On the point about jurisdiction, however, I would still say
that the case study only made reference to compliance with US federal
regulation. So ignoring ACM and BCS for a moment, I maintain that they would
need to assess local compliance and potentially make changes in order to comply
with local regulations before deploying to other regions.</p>

<p>Your second point about the presumption of fault after the
fact is interesting. I agree that no system is completely secure, and your
reference was a good read. I also agree that it would be unhelpful to assume
that a system was not designed robustly and securely simply because it has been
compromised. However, I disagree with your view that there was no evidence to
suggest that measures were inadequate. ACM principle 2.9 says “Computing
professionals should perform due diligence to ensure the system functions as
intended, and take appropriate action to secure resources against accidental
and intentional misuse, modification, and denial of service. As threats can
arise and change after a system is deployed, computing professionals should <b>integrate
mitigation techniques and policies</b>, such as monitoring, patching, and
vulnerability reporting. Computing professionals should also <b>take steps to
ensure parties affected by data breaches are notified in a timely and clear
manner</b>, providing appropriate guidance and remediation.” (Association for
Computing Machinery, 2018). Anyone developing a content filter would surely be
aware of the risk of bad actors trying to compromise is, so whilst it’s not
possible to prevent an attack, they should have been aware of the likelihood,
and if not they would surely be contravening principle 2.6 “Perform work only
in areas of competence.” So on the basis that they were aware of the risks,
they should have included mitigation techniques and policies to deal with them.
On the contrary, they had no easy way to correct the model, suggesting that mitigation
had not been considered during design, and they failed to notify their
stakeholders about the problem. Based upon those two points, my view remains
that Blocker Plus failed to adhere to principle ACM 2.9. But we agree that the
ramifications are reputational and not legal.</p>
