												<h2>Reflections</h2>
											</header>
											<h3>Unit 1: An Introduction to Your Dissertation</h3>
											<p>
												<br>I was unsure how the project module was going to be delivered. So far, prior to the start of the module, I have:
												<ul>
													<li>Propsed a project</li>
													<li>Discussed and refined the idea with Steph, the tutor from the Research Methods and Professional Practice module</li>
													<li>Secured a first supervisor; Godfried Williams, because the proposal includes producing an ontology and Godfried taught the Knowledge Representation and Reasonoing module</li>
													<li>Discussed the proposal with Godfried and further refined it</li>
													<li>Secured a second supervisor; Sammy Danso, who taught the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence module and who was initially going to teach the Knowledge Representation and Reasonng module before being replaced by Godfried, hence I assume also knowledgeable about ontologies.</li>
												</ul>
												I was concerned that the project would be entirely self directed. However, there is still some structure for the first few weeks to produce and agree the project proposal, and there is a minimum number of supervisor meetings that I can call upon, so there is more structure than I was expecting, which is good.
												<br><br>The unit started with a lecturecast covering the elements of a dissertation and, at a very high level, how to approach it. There was also some reading that went over how to present a report.
												<br><br>By far the biggest benefit of this unit was looking ahead at the structure for the rest of the module so I can prepare!
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 2: Project Planning and Risks</h3>
											<p>
												<br>This was a very simple refresher unit considering my past eperience with project management. It covered project planning; both waterfall and agile, and project risks.
												<br><br>This week I submitted my project outline for the dissertation. It was a little odd to write an abstract for something that has not yet been written, and it covered many of the same points as the itemised list of requirements such as research question, aims, objectives, artefacts etc., but it still gives a good overview of my proposed project:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Project/Project outline.pdf" class="button">Project Outline</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 3: Project Types and Research Methods</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Another refresher unit, the lecturecast covered project types and research methods whilst the reading, some from Dawson (2015) which I had already purchased for the research methods and professional practice module,  went into further detail on research methods and data.
												<br><br>I also submitted a brief overview of my proposed research methods for foramtive review. It's quite short and it was a little difficult to write considering there will be no primary research so the methods are really just experimentation:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Project/Research methods.pdf" class="button">Research Methods</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 4: Reviewing Literature</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecurecast and reading had some useful pointers for the literature review. Bloom's taxonomy (Bloom, 1956) showed a logical evolution of a literature review as: descriptive -> interpretation -> analysis -> synthesis. 
												It was also useful to get some guidance on the ratio of good sources, with the recommendation being at least 60% from peer reviewed sources and up to 40% from other sources. 
												Another useful tip was to create a table of literature themes to structure the review, which I will try to do. Finally, there was a reminder of the need to be critical in the review and not just submit a collection of references. 
												<br><br>I created and submitted a structure for my literature review for formative feedback:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Project/Literature review structure.pdf" class="button">Literature Review Structure</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 5: Research Ethics</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast and reading all concerned research ethics pertaining to primary research. My dissertation will not include primary research so much of it won't be relevent to me, although I will still be requried to get ethical approval for my project, and there will be general ethical considerations such as ensuring the results are accurate e.g. by using trusterd sources for the data.
												<br><br>To prepare for that I submitted an outline of the ethical considerations for my project for formative feedback:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Project/Ethical considerations.pdf" class="button">Ethical Considerations</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 6: Intellectual Property</h3>
											<p>
												<br>This was a light week, with the lecturecast and reading covering intellectual property in the form of patents, copyrights and trademarks. Most I was already aware of and I don't believe that any will be particularly relevant to my dissertation.
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 7-8: Research Proposal and Ethical Approval Submission</h3>
											<p>
												I have made excellent progress with the literature review. I believe I have all of the requried references and have drafted an initial literature review but most of the findings are independent so I need to work on linking them together into a single narrative. The word count is around 6,500 words excluding references so it might need to be shortened a little too before final submittion, depending upon how long the rest of my dissertation is.
												<br><br>I submitted my research propsal and ethical approval, which is the final formal submision before the actual dissertation is submitted. The research proposal is below. The ethical approval section is not included because it was largely N/A due to the dissertation having no primary research/human participants component:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Project/Research proposal and ethical approval.pdf" class="button">Research proposal and ethical approval</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 9-30: Dissertation!</h3>
											<p>
												<br>After weeks of hard work, which I won't attempt descibe here, the dissertation is complete. I'm really happy with the result which is below, along with my artefact presentation.
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Project/Dissertation.pdf" class="button">Dissertation</a></li>
												</ul>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Project/Dissertation artefact presentation.pdf" class="button">Artefact Presentation</a></li>
												</ul>
												This now concludes my MSc in Artificial Intelligence. It's been challenging, especially finding the time to study alongside a full-time job, but it's also been really rewarding. I've learned a lot, worked with some interesting people; lecturers and students, and I'm really pleased to have done it.
