<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>There are currently many applications of deep learning. <span
class=SpellE>Narasimman</span> (2023) has helpfully compiled a list, including self-driving
cars, virtual assistants, fraud detection, image colouring and advertising, to
name a few. Interesting they don’t mention generative AI such as GPT which
seems like a strange omission given the recent publicity. In any case, for my
example of a deep learning application I have chosen to find something that has
not yet been discussed in order to bring a fresh perspective. To that end I have
chosen to look at breast cancer diagnosis using deep learning. This isn’t a
completely new topic, but it hasn’t been discussed so far in this module.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Medical diagnosis by human experts can be significantly
improved with the use of deep learning (Azad et al, 2021). There have been many
recent experiments to diagnose skin cancer using convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). <span class=SpellE>Haggenmüller</span> et al (2021) examined 19 such studies
and found that all of the CNN models gave superior or equivalent performance to
trained clinicians. There is a caveat, however, that most of the studies were
conducted using a single image for each patient. Clinicians performed better
when given multiple images and additional information such as patient age and
sex, and the location of the lesion. It still looks very encouraging though. I
expect a solution incorporating the additional details that improve clinician
accuracy could also be used to improve the deep learning solution accuracy too.
For example, the CNN could be trained not to provide a binary malignant or
benign output, but rather some weighted outputs that could then go into another
algorithm such as an artificial neural network (ANN), or even a decision tree, where
the additional data such as age, gender and lesion location could be included
to calculate the final diagnoses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Telemedicine, whereby patients consult with clinicians via audio-visual
media on their smartphones, and specifically <span class=SpellE>teledermatology</span>
focusing on early diagnosis of skin cancer, is already growing in popularity
due to its time saving for both the patient and the clinician (<span
class=SpellE>Fabbrocini</span>, 2011). It seems a natural step, therefore, to
take the same smartphone but send the pictures to a CNN for initial diagnosis,
referring to a clinician where necessary. Studies are already underway in this
area (Azad, 2021).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>That all sounds good, but there are of course ethical
considerations. Firstly, deep learning models rely on large volumes of data on which
to be trained. Medical data is, but it’s nature, sensitive, so patient
confidentiality must be considered when training the models.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Next there is the question of accuracy. If an advertising algorithm
gets it wrong, you might see an advert that doesn’t interest you. If a medical
diagnosis algorithm gets it wrong you could be mis-diagnosed with potentially lethal
consequences. The stakes are high, so accuracy is always a hot topic. However,
clinicians don’t always get it right either. So is accuracy equivalent or
better than a clinician all that is needed? Perhaps, but what if you are one
who is mis—diagnosed by the deep learning algorithm? You would be quite
justified in asking if the same mistake would have been made by a clinician. Averages
and statistics are fine, but with it’s you personally then it becomes binary;
right or wrong. It’s a difficult conundrum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>I do believe, however, that this use case of early
detection and referral for potential skin cancer could be a very good example. It
could be a self-service tool for people who have noticed an unusual lesion to
get an instant answer to the question “should I be worried?”. The algorithm
could be trained to be err on the side of caution, referring even marginal
cases to an actual clinician, so the clinician still saves time by not seeing
the people who are obviously clear, but they still have the final say on
everyone else, at least while the accuracy continues to improve until it can potentially
be allowed to “run solo”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>In the current climate of overworked healthcare staff and the
availability of smartphones to practically everyone, personally I think this is
an excellent use of deep learning, provided it is implemented carefully, with
patient health taking precedence over clinical efficiency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
