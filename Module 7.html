												<h2>Reflections</h2>
											</header>
											<h3>Unit 1: Scientific Investigation and Ethics</h3>
											<p>
												<br>My first thought when reviewing the content of this module was "wow, it's going to be a lot of work". On a personal note I was informed last week that I'm being made redundant from the company I have worked for for 34 years so I'm feeling anxious on many levels. 
												I'm definitly going to need to get into a good headspace for this module. 
												<br><br>The first seminar was useful because on one hand it confirmed that it's going to be an intensive module, but it also helped to position the module, and the fact that it runs over the Christmas break and so gives a little more time sounds helpful. The tutor, Steph Paladini, seems helpful too. 
												One recommendation from the seminar was to start using a references manager. I've been doing references manually up to now, but looking at the quantity of references that will be needed for this module, and even more for the final project, I will certainly be looking at that and have downloaded Mendeley to give it a try. 
												<br><br>The reading covered ethics in research, and also the nature of research such as the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning (which I still need to think carefully about to differentiate). There was also a short quiz, but the questions were practically the same as in one of the required readings, although it was still good to practice. 
												Although there was a lot of reading, especially for the first week in a new module, it was actually relatively simple, so I'm feeling a bit less anxious about the module already (I still foresee a huge amount of work though). 
												<br><br>The first collaborative discussion started with a review of a case study from the Association of Computing Machinering (ACM), comparing the case study assessment of the ACM ethics code with the British Computer Society (BCS) code of conduct. My initial post is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Initial post 1.html" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Unit 2 started with a lecturecast which did a really good job of describing how and why to pose a research question alongside the methods (high level) and importance of a good literatre review. It put this module into context very well. In fact I think it would've been good to have in unit 1, but unit 2 isn't far behind so not a real problem.
												<br><br>The reading, mainly from the core textbook (Dawson, 2015), described why a literature review is important in projects and how to go about it, which is clearly going to be very useful. I found the "spiralling in" concept (Dawson, 2015: 96) particularly useful in appreciating how to itertively focus in on a research topic. There was also a good explanation of when to use Internet sources. I knew that they were less academically sound, but the explanation of using them as a start point for further reserch was a good tip. 
												<br><br>I contributed some peer responses to the colaborative discussion:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Peer responses 1.html" class="button">Peer Responses</a></li>
												</ul>
												I've tried to look into the topics available for the literature review and research proposal, and spent a lot of time this week considering the options, but I'm still struggling to nail down what to select which will help with my final project (the problem being that I don't know what to do for that project eaither). I have some potential options but I think I need to discuss them first to see if they sound reasonable, and how I would get the data needed to build a model.
												<br><br>Some good news; this week I was told that I am no loner being made redundant from work, at least for now. So that stress has now been lifted, although it has taken it's toll.
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 3: Research Methods</h3>
											<p>
												<br>This week the reading was about research design, being exploratory or conclusive, and research methods, being qualitative, quantitative of mixed methods. Each of course is broken down into many more categories such as interviews and surveys for qualitative and experiment and surveys for quantitative (the nature of the survey determining if it is qualitative or quantitative). 
												<br><br>The seminar covered the same topics and emphasised some important points. The "research onion" was a useful model and most useful, to me at least, was the emphasis on defining teh right research question to lead to a good research design. This has helped to clarify what is needed for the literature review exercise, in that having been givena list of topics we still need to come up with a specific question within a given topic. I now understad better what is needed to this week I will focus on defining a good question on which to base the literature review.
												<br><br>The seminar also inclued a discussion about the peer review activity. Unfortunately only two students attended the seminar. Mubarak Dada had fully prepared his peer review on two papers and gave a good overview which we discussed and critiqued. I had only completed one paper so we also discussed that and I finished the review with the second paper after the seminar. It was still a useful and interesting discussion and my completed peer review is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Peer review.pdf" class="button">Peer Review</a></li>
												</ul>
												The collaborative discussion finished this week too. My summary post is here:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Summary post 1.html" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>
												I also made my first draft of a research proposal for my final project. There is still too much that I don't yet know to be confident that this will be anything close to the final research question, but it got me thinking about research methods and what the final project could potentially look like, so a good exercise to do in draft at this early stage:

												</ul>											
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The reading this week was very light, covering only research methods such as action research, experimentation, case studies, surveys and observation. This was very welcome, because this week I completed an outline for the literatire review due in unit 7 for formative feedback. If was a very time consuming task to find, read, understanbd, assess to keep/discard, and then comment upon the documents to keep for the literatire review. 
												I haven't summarised all of the documents that I intend to use yet, but there are enough to get some feedback on the approach which I hope will be useful for my final submission in unit 7. My outline literative review is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Literature review outline.pdf" class="button">Literature review outline</a></li>
												</ul>
												I also completed a short case study on privacy in readiness for next week's seminar:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Case study on privacy.pdf" class="button">Case study on privacy</a></li>
												</ul>
												Finally, I have some concerns about the complexity of gathering the required data for my proposed final project so I have asked for some input from the tutor, Steph. I hope to speak with her about it next week.
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods</h3>
											<p>
												<br>There was a lecturecast this week on interviews and surveys, which also covered pre and post-testing to measure changes. It was very basic didn't cover anything that I didn't already know.
												<br><br>The reading from Dawson (2015) covered surveys and interviews at a similarly high-level, although the points on preparing for an interview was a useful checklist. 
												The reading from Berenson et al (2020) on the other hand suddenhjly introducted statistical concepts such as standard error rate of teh mean and sampling from normal distributions, which whilst relevent to survey they seemed to be introduced very abruptly so I have asked for clarification that the reading is correct.
