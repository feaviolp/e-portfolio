												<h3>Reflections</h3>
											</header>
											<h3>Unit 1</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast "Introduction to Agent-Based Computing" provided a good introduction to the subject area, including the relevence of agent-based computing in society. The speech on the videos was too fast to follow easily, and the final quiz had a question whose answer was clearly incorrect, but overall it was a good introduction lecturecast. 
												<br><br>The reading was only chapter 2 of the core book "An Introduction to Multiagent Systems" which continued the introduction to agents, including defining agents and describing reactive agents vs. agents with state. 
												<br><br>There was a collaborative discussion about what led to the rise of agent-based systems. I gave some examples within supply chain management. My initial post can be found here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Initial post 1.htm" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 2</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Unit 2 covered First Order Logic. The reading was quite deep and the seminar, which unfortunately occured before I was able to complete the reading, was also very deep and I struggled to keep up. This is an area that I'm going to need to re-visit to become proficient. 
												Interestingly, Prolog was mentioned during the seminar, and I briefly used Prolog during my BSc studies (far too many years ago) so I hope that, given a little time and additional reading it will come back to me. 
												<br><br>This week also included commenting on other people's posts for the collaborative discussion. I commented on Astrid van Toor's post about different types of agents in traffic management, supply chain, and modelling climate change, and Samuel Adeniyi's post about the rise of agent-based systems due to the increasing complexity of modern business environments. 
												<br><br>The groups for the group project were announced this week too. I'm in a group with Astrid van Toor and Anastasia Rizzo which is good because I'm confident that we will work well together. 
												We had a kick-off call (meeting notes below) where we discussed the project in detail, which is about producing a design proposal for an agent based system. We decided to design an Online Academic Research tool and and agreed to each research agents further and forulate draft project requirements and a project plan so we can bring our ideas together next week to finalise the plan and alocate tasks. 
												We also agreed a team contract (link below). We have scheduled weekly checkpoint calls until the project finishes.

													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Team Contract.pdf" class="button">Team Contract</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 3</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast introduced agent architectures including deductive reasoning architecture, practical reasoning architecture and subsumption architecture. 
												<br><br>We had a call this week to discuss things that we needed to clarify about the team project, and then a call with the tutor to seek those clarification. Notes from both meetings below:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Prep for tutor call.pdf" class="button">Prep for call with tutor</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Tutor clarification.pdf" class="button">Tutor clarifications</a></li>
												</ul>
												The reading was various papers describing different approaches for agent architecture. Some of the reading was quite dep, and I don’t profess to fully understanding it all, but it’s clear that there are different ways to represent how to design and build agent bases systems. 
												In fact one thing that struck me was how Maes (1991) talks about modules within an agent in the same way that others talk about individual agents in a multi-agent system. There doesn’t appear to be a universal definition of the “size” of an agent, let along how to “connect” then in a standardised architecture.
												<br>Maes, P. (1991) The Agent Network Architecture (ANA). <i>SIGART Bulletin</i> 2(4): 115-120.
												<br><br>Finally, I submitted my summary post for the collaborative discussion:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Summary post 1.htm" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 4</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Following the project team call and tutor clarification call last week I looked further into how to diagramatically represent agent system designs and I found an Agent UML (AUML) proposed by Bauer et at (2001). This looked like an excellent way to take the UML sequence diagram that I had already drafted and make a few small changes to better illustrate the agent architecture. 
												I have drafted a new version following the AUML guidelines and sent to the team for review on Friday's checkpoint call. The diagram has also raised a few important design points that need to be agreed so we'll discuss those on Friday too. 
												<br>Bauer, B., Müller, J.P. and Odell, J. (2001) Agent UML: A Formalism for Specifying Multiagent Software Systems. <i>International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering</i>, 11(03): 207-230. 
												<br><br>We held the first checkpoint call where key design issues were discussed and decisions made. We have a few more actions to complete before we can finish the desigh proposal. 
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 1.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 1</a></li>
												</ul>
												The seminar and reading for this week both focused on hybrid agent architectures. It was interesting to see different agent architecures and it helped to answer a question that I been pondering about what point an agent can be considered to be an "intelligent agent". 
												It seems that our project design is utilising one of the simplest agent architectures; the reactive "subsumption architecure" (Brooks, 1991), whereby situations produce actions without reasoning. 
												<br>Brooks, R.A. (1991) Intelligence without representation. <i>Artificial intelligence</i>, 47(1-3): 139-159.
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 5</h3>
											<p>
												<br>This lecturecast was very different to others on the course so far, starting with a discussion about the semantics of speech before briefly covering the agent based communication language KQML, which will be covered in more detail in later reading. 
												Frustratingly, once again the quiz required an incorrect answer on order to achieve 100%. 
												<br><br>The reading this week was extremely verbose. Searle (1969) went to great lengths to effectively decompose langage into "speech acts" which are individual tokens of inforamtion that vary depending upon context. 
												The simplicity of my summary compared to the length of the book serves to illustrate the challenge, in that the book attempts to codify natural language, which relies upon a general understanding of contexct and meaning between the person speaking and the person being spoken to. It turns out that codifying it is incredibly complicated! 
												<br><br>This is brought back to the topic of agents with Payne and Tamma (2014) who propose a method for agents to negotiate with each other when their ontologies and goals differ. This is something that I hadn't really thought about before, thinking that agents simply pass requests and responses back and forth, but in a true multi-agent system where agents are independent with different goals, a way to negotiate as well as just send instructions and responses does seem necessary.  
												<br>Payne, T.R. & Tamma, V. (2014) Negotiating over ontological correspondences with asymmetric and incomplete knowledge. <i>AAMAS</i> 13(1): 517-524.
												<br>Searle, J.R. (1969) <i>Speech Acts: An Essay in the Philosophy of Language.</i> Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
												<br><br>Unfortunately Anastasia decided to leave our project group this week for personal reasons and join another group. We are almost ready to submit the project and it's been almost all Astrid and my work to date anyway so this shouldn't pose any problems for us.
												<br><br>Finally, another collaborative discussion started this week about the advantages and disadvantages of the agent communication language (ACL) Knowledge Query and Manipulation language (KQML). My initial post is here: 
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Initial post 2.htm" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 6</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The reading this week was much simpler, which was a refreshing change from last week. It was even easier because, by coincidence, I had already read Finin et al (1994) last week for the collaborative discussion. 
												<br><br>I commented on Vasilisa Lukashevich and Alberto Castro's posts in the collaborative dsicussion with similar comments in both, which was to say that I felt their descriptions of multi-agent systems when describing Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) were more like distributed systems than pure multi-agent systems with fuly autonomous agents, wo KQML would be less useful anyway. 
												<br><br>There was a formative activity to create a simple agent dialogue in KQML and KIF between two agents. I don't think it's exactly right, but my answer is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Agent Dialogue.html" class="button">Agent Dialogue</a></li>
												</ul>
												Astrid and I completed and submitted the team project design proposal document:

													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Design Proposal Document.pdf" class="button">Design Proposal Document</a></li>

											</p>
											<h3>Unit 7</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast about Natural Language Processing was interesting, showing how words are associated with each other using three dimensional vectors. The complexities of language, with words that have multiple meanings and situational context etc. make this a challenging and interesting topic. 
												<br>The reading covered word representation and handwriting recognition using artificial neural networks (ANNs), which was a topical overlap with the machine learning module where we're currently also studying ANNs.
												<br>Having submitted project 1 last week we held an initiation meeting for project 2:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Project 2 initiation.pdf" class="button">Project 2 Initiation</a></li>
												</ul>
												This week concluded the collaborative discussion about Agent Communication Languages. My summary post is here: 
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Summary post 2.htm" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 8</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The seminar this week was about Natural Language Processing (NLP). It was interesting to learn about word embedding, which is vector representations of words in context, which can be frequency based or prediction based.
												We also discussed pre-processing of text, such as removing HTML tags, tokenising words, and removing stop words such as "and", "is", "an" etc., which make sentences easier to read for humans but just add noise for NLP.
												<br>The reading discussed parse trees which is about how words are linked within sentences, used in NLP. There was also a formative activity to create parse trees for three simple sentences:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/parse_trees.html" class="button">Parse Trees</a></li>
												</ul>
												We also held our first checkpoint call for the second team project:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 2 1.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 1</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 9</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecass covered Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
												We've just learned about ANNs and CNNs in the Machine Learning module, so the reminder was good, but I have to say that the Machine Learning lecturecast was easier to follow so I'm glad that I saw that one first. 
												It was interesting to hear about RNNs though, which was a new topic. 
												<br><br>The "reading" was one Forbes article and two videos. The article was a strangely written but quite insightlful review (albeit 8 years old) about the motivations of AI, using Microsoft's deep learning outperforming a human in image recognition as the hook. 
												The videos were lecures by Andrew Ng on deep learning. Some of the content had already been covered in the CNN material from the Machine Learning module, but the lectures went into more details about how the algorithms work conceptually rather than just mathematically. 
												The sparse coding looking for edge angles in images rather than individual pixels, and similar features in sound and touch was very clever. I wonder if sparse coding could outperform CNNs? I also liked the quote "it's not who has the best algorithm that wins, it's who has the most data". 
												<br><br>Another collaborative discussion started this week about ethical implications of generative AI. My initial post is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Initial post 3.htm" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>	
												The team project is going very well, having started it during the first project. We had our second checkpoint call:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 2 2.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 2</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 10</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The core reading this week was how deep learning can improve productivity and boost business, from the world economic forum. It was quite high level, and suprising how little the risks were mentioned, although not omitted altogether. 
												There was also self-directed reading about deep learning, ChatGPT, OpenAI etc. I found myself finding very little that I hadn't already read, which I suppose means my previous research was good?!? 
												I responded to two posts in the discussion forum. One to Astrid van Toor about artisitc styles being plagiarised by generatie AI, and the other to Samuel Adeniyi (including Astrid again) about teh pitfalls of trying to control generative AI with guardrails, albeit necessary, and how that might have implications on free speech and create it's own kind of social engineering if implemented carelessly. 
												<br><br>We had a project checkpoint call where we discussed finalising the code and started to think about how it will be presented:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 2 3.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 3</a></li>
												</ul>
												We also had a formative activity to discuss a practical application of deep learning:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Deep learning.htm" class="button">Deep Learning</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 11</h3>
											<p>
												We had our final checkpoint call for the team project. We've made excellent progress and just need to complete the recording of the presentation to submit on Monday:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Checkpoint 2 4.pdf" class="button">Checkpoint 4</a></li>
												</ul>
												<br>The lecturecast and reading this week covered real life applications for inteligent agents, which was interesting. I've come across digital twins in my work previously alongside IoT, and we've discussed intelligent supply chains and Dall-E in the collaborative discussions already. 
												I also noted the problem of deadlocks in an easlier collaborative discussion, which was also discussing in one of the papers with a proposed solution being a coordinator agent, so it was interesting getting alternative views on that previousl topic too. 
												It's always interesting, for me at least, to look at real-world applications for the academic topics that we're learning about. DopeLearning was funny though - I thought it was a spelling mistake for Deep Learning until I read further that it was a tool to generate rap lyrics. I'm left wondering how, or even if, they deal with profanities since they are often core to rap lyrics today.  
												<br><br>I submittted my summary post for the collaborative discussion about ethical implications of generative AI, under the title of Deep Learning:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Summary post 3.htm" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>	
												We also submitted our team project presentation, which we're very pleased with. The submission included a video recording of the presentation plus the slides and transcript, the source code and executable files. The slides are here:

													<li><a href="Modules/Module6/Academic Paper Search Application Presentation.pdf" class="button">Academic Paper Search Application Presentation</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 12</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Unit 12 looked at the future of intelligent agents. The reading was lighter in this final unit, which was welcome since the individual reflection also had to be written this week and I hadn't started it early due to completing the team project in unit 11. 
												It was still a useful read, about artificial intelligence incidents and ethics. Much was reinforcement of what had already been covered, but one comment about autonomous drone swarms being a weapon of mass destruction struck a chord with me given the current war in Ukraine and the way that both Russia and Ukraine are adapting their weapons for strategic advantage, as well as due to supply issues of conventional weapons.
