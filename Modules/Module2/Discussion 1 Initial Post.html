									<p><b>Discuss why AI is now ubiquitous and why it is important for companies to invest in AI technologies
									</b></p>
									<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is everywhere. It pervades our personal, social and professional lives. Sometimes we’re aware of it, but often it sits in the background quietly using an ever expanding dataset derived from our regular habits to personalise our experiences.
									</p>
									<p>Voice assistants such as Amazon Echo and Google Home use conversational AI (Ponnusamy et al 2020) which were estimated to be in more than half of UK homes in 2019 (Easton, 2021). There is also a voice assistant inside every smartphone.
									</p>
									<p>Recruitment is often streamlined by AI such as chatbots to guide candidates through the recruitment process and to screen applications quickly and without unconscious bias (Upadhyay & Khandelwal, 2018). However, bias can sometimes be inadvertently introduced into AI solutions such as the recruitment tool that Amazon scrapped when it “learned” to become biased against women (Dastin 2022).
									</p>
									<p>Recommendation systems are a particularly common application of AI to improve customer experience, such as buying suggestions from Amazon, and what to watch from Netflix (Burgess, 2018). Looking further into the Netflix example, Netflix uses deep-learning models to recommend to its members what to watch based upon their own viewing habits compared with other members who have watched similar things, alongside other data such as if they gave it a thumbs up/down (Steck et al, 2021). This is an important feature because Netflix is a subscription service with growing competition and a huge amount of content. It is easy for customers to cancel their subscription so Netflix needs to constantly remain relevant to each individual customer, which it does through the use of AI powered recommendations. This means they will be more engaged and less likely to cancel their subscription. The Netflix business model fundamentally relies upon the AI powered recommendations to maintain their subscriber base.
									</p>
									<p>A final note about ethics pertaining to recommendation systems. It was earlier highlighted that Amazon had to withdraw a recruitment tool that had become biased. That’s an obvious example of a solution that had become unethical and was dealt with accordingly. But what about something so seemingly trivial as recommending what film to watch? That couldn’t be unethical, right? At worst it might be inaccurate and fail to meet the customer retention objective. Consider that the recommender algorithm is curating what you watch. Now consider that it’s been accepted for a long time that “there are profoundly important relationships between [films] and human [behaviour]” (Fearing, 1947). Could a nefarious film recommender system be used for social engineering? Perhaps. This is simply to illustrate that ethics must be considered in all applications of AI because AI systems make decisions that will have consequences.
