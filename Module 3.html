												<h3>Reflections</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I approached this module with some trepidation given the long time since I studied anything mathematical. 
												It wasnâ€™t especially easy starting the module because the first seminar was after two weeks, so it was all reading/self-study to begin with.
											</p>
											<p>Unit 1 lecturecasts gave a good introduction to R along with introducting methods of statistical measurement. 
												Reading for Unit 1 was not too bad, and R seems to be a fairly simple language so far. 
												"Practical statistics for data scientists" is well written and easy to work through. 
												"Introductory Business Statistics" repeated many of the same concepts with the focus mainly on practical exercises which I didn't find time to do in week 1. 
												"Basic Business Statistics: Concepts and Applications" was not available from the university online library so was not covered. 
												Finally, the data activities were simple, giving a nice, gentle introduction to using R.
											</p>
											<p>Unit 2 lecturecast on data structures in R was less engaging than the first. 
												The linked videos from Khan Academy were interesting and useful, although it wasn't clear how many were supposed to be watched because a new one would auto-start every each one finished. 
												I found scalars, vectors and matrices conceptually simply. 
												Adding, subtracting and multiplying matrices was also relatively straightforward, but inverting matrices was not! 
												Back to the lecturecast, the worked examples in R lacked any explanation as to why certain commands were being used, and without reference (yet) to any R coding books it was a little challenging to work out how commands were constructed, even though they were quite simple. 
												Starting with an overview of basic R commands would've been easier. 
												The reading was OK, especially as I had inadvertantly read what was needed in unit 2 from "Practical statistics for data scientists" in unit 1, although this week I made time to try some examples in RStudio.
											</p>
											<p>Unit 3 lecturecast was again quite weak. 
												It started with an overly basic video explaining file types and extension that could've just been a quick bit of text, but then skipped over how to examine datasets and variables with very little context. 
												I answered the quiz with 100% but still don't feel like I learned much. 
												This was underlined when reading "R you ready? Using the R program for statistical analysis and graphics" in which I struggled to follow the commands, and they didn't all work on my local installation of R or the Codio verion either. 
												I need an "overview of R" reference. 
												The seminar was interesting. 
												It was good to meet Russell, who was reassuring about the difficulty of the module, and the seminar was more interactive than the previous module, which made it more worthwhile. 
												Finally, the 100 Numpy exercises were difficult with limited experience with Python and none in Numpy. 
												I ended up just running through the answers, which was somewhat useful but probably not what was intended. 
												I started experimenting with R this week in readiness for the Statistical Analysis Presentation due in unit 12. 
											</p>
											<p>Unit 4 lecuturecast was better. The introduction to probabilities was basic, but covered useful simple notation. 
												The second half discussing the formulae for binomial, poisson and hypergeometric distributions was more difficult, and I won't remember the formulae, but it was still a good overview.
												Similarly, the online simulations of discrete probability distributions (binomial, poisson and hypergeometric) and continuous probability distributions (normal, uniform, exponential and gaussian) were interesting but I didn't really understand what they were telling me so I will need to revist later whenI have learned more of the context. 
												Chapter 3 of "Introductory Business Statistics" gave a good overview of probabilities, and whilst I conly did a selection of the exercises, they were very useful to cement the learning. 
											</p>
											<p>Unit 5 had no lecurecast.
												The reading built upopn previous topics covered in previous reading and videos so it wasn't too taxing this week. I mainly skimmed through it because there was more practical work to focus on.
												The practical work centred around the collaborative discussion set for this week. A table in a medical journal paper had to be presented in a more reader friendly way by using plots. 
												It took a lot of experimentation and help from Google to eventually plot a stacked bar chart using ggplot in R. The results were posted in the discussion forum as shown in the Initial Post link on this page. It was interesting to see that Astrid took an almost identical approach, although the result was formatted slightly differently. 
												ggplot is a powerful tool that can produce results quite quickly and simply, but it can become complicated when more than just basic presentation is needed.
												In fact I'm find that's true of R in general. It's quick to pick-up and do basic things, but it has powerful functions available to those prepared to learn and exploit them. 
												I did the seminar preparation after my discussion post. The seminar preparation included a video about ggplot which was very insightful. After doing the discussion exercise by trial and error I feel that I understand ggplot much more after watching the video.
											</p>
											<p>Unit 6 had a lot of reading covering confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, statsitical significance and p values. 
												There was a lot to read and I didn't have enough time to do it all thoroughly. However, the supplementary videos from Khan Academy were very useful and covered the topics well. 
												The statistics quiz wasn't particularly helpful. The questions were vewry simplistic and sometimes worded ambiguously leading to an incorrect answer when I knew what was meant by the correct answer. I don't feel that this has prepared me for the exam (if that is what it was intended to do). 
												I commented on Astrid's post in the discussion forum and she commented on mine. Unfortunately we were the only two to contribute. The comments were useful to learn some alternative methods, as well as validating the approached that we each took, but input from a wider audience would've made it more useful. 
											</p>
											<p>Unit 7 reading covered t-tests and ANOVA which again I skimmed over and will refer back when I have soe,mthing practical to do.
												The exam was not as easy as expected. Hving been told it should be possible to finish in 30 mins (with time limit of 60 minut) I found that it took the entire 60 minutes and even then I wasn't completely happy with my answeres.
												The topics were broadly the ones that we had studied, but the depth needed was greater than we were told in the seminars so I hope I've done enough.
