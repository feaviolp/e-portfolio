                    <p>In my initial post I claimed that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous. Maclean (2022a) disagreed, saying “there are many areas where AI has not made an impact”, which he explained further in (Maclean 2022b) with examples of immature AI. I acknowledge the challenge but remain of the view that AI is ubiquitous, with perhaps a more casual definition, because whilst not strictly “everywhere”, and not always mature, it is difficult to find examples of places where AI is not having at least some impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>I gave examples of recommendation systems that use AI for competitive advantage. Similar examples were discussed in van Toor (2022a) with more details about collaborative filtering and other techniques. This prompted me to explore deeper and discover that recommender systems typically use multiple techniques for best results, especially to deal with cold users and cold content (Feaviour, 2022a).
                    </p>
                    <p>I mentioned recruitment systems powered by AI, and specifically one that Amazon retired when it became biased (Dastin 2018). Van Toor (2022b) asked why Amazon did not re-train the model to remove the bias. I suggested that it would be difficult to be sure that other biases had not been introduced instead, but I suspect the real reason was to avoid negative public reaction, as suggested by Lambert (2022a).
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, I explained that ethics is important across AI, including recommender systems for entertainment that have the potential for social engineering. Lambert (2022a) agreed in principle, albeit over a long period, with which I concur. However, Maclean (2022a) felt this was less about AI and more about general censoring, also discussed in Lambert (2022b). Whilst censoring is an issue, I made the point that total content censoring is not a consequence of unethical AI (Feaviour 2022b), but unethical AI can still control the content that we consume (Feaviour 2022c).
