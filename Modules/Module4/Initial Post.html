<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>The genie is well and truly out of the bottle! Large
language models have been around for some time, but in November 2022 GPT-3
(ChatGPT) made it easily accessible to the public, and it quickly went viral (Marr,
2023). The combination of the power, the broad scope, and the ease of use has
made it the topic of conversation from technical conferences to family dinners.
ChatGPT is becoming to generative AI what Google is to the search engine. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>There has been a lot of discussion and speculation about the
potential negative impact on education, such as using ChatGPT to pass exams
(Shearing &amp; McCallum, 2023) and coursework (Acres, 2023). Those discussions,
however, assume that the teaching syllabus and assessment methods remain
unchanged. As the world, and especially technology, develops around us, shouldn’t
we prepare our children by adapting their education to meet their changing
needs? Heaven (2023) assessed the likely impact of ChatGPT on education and found
that it should have a broadly positive impact, but it will take some effort on
the part of education institutions. Two quotes that resonated with me from that
article are “In a system with too much focus on grading and not enough on
learning, ChatGPT is forcing a debate that is overdue” (Helen Crompton, associate
professor of instructional technology) and “Did ChatGPT kill assessments? They
were probably already dead, and they’ve been in zombie mode for a long time.
What ChatGPT did was call us out on that” (Richard Culatta, CEO of the
International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)). The fact does remain
though, that in the short-term ChatGPT can be used to cheat so education
institutions will need to take steps to guard against that while looking at how
to adapt and modernise the entire approach to education in the future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Sticking with education, Kasneci et al (2023) believes that
large language models provide opportunities to create educational content,
improving student engagement with personalised learning experiences. They note
challenges too, such as the need to fact-check the generated content, and risks
of bias, but those are not unique to generative AI. In fact, if the bulk of the
content can be generated automatically, at a higher and more personalised
standard that before, that leaves more time to polish the materials including
fact and bias checking. So the key is augmenting, not replacing, the teacher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>It's a similar story in the world of work. Large language
models such as ChatGPT can be used to accelerate the work of people. Microsoft
is integrating large language models into it’s Microsoft 365 suite to provide
natural language prompts based upon a user’s data, such as highlighting important
activities and summarising multiple emails and chats (Spataro, 2023). Also, ChatGPT
can be used to generate draft content that can be edited and used, similar to
the education use case above. However, care should be taken because ChatGPT is
still new, and OpenAI give no liability for damages arising from it’s use. They
also use the input and output data to develop and improve the model “which places
the risk on the user to ensure that such transfer to OpenAI is permitted under
data protection law” (Raven, 2023). So putting personal or commercially sensitive
data into ChatGPT should be avoided, but huge value can still be extracted by
using abstracted data, and with cloud computing bigger organisations can build
their own large language models with their data safely contained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>I attended the AI Summit in London two weeks ago and a quote
that I remember, although I can’t remember who said it, was “people shouldn’t be
afraid of generative AI taking their jobs, they should be afraid of people who
can use generative AI better than they can taking their jobs”. I believe that’s
true. Generative AI is providing a new toolkit for people to use, and a new set
of skills (prompt engineering) to use it. People who learn to use the tool effectively,
including understanding it’s challenges and limitations such as accuracy and
bias and navigating around them, will succeed. And this brings me back to
education. Let’s not fear generative AI. Let’s embrace it, use it to enrich the
education of the next generation, and especially make sure that people are
educated to be able to maximise the value from it whilst appreciating it’s
limitations.</span></p>
