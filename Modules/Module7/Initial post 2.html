<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical
programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the
nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data,
he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him
to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to
refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate
that Whizzz is harmful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Abi also realises that some other correlations could be
performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he
thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Ethical Concerns</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?</li>
	<li>Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?</li>
	<li>Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?</li>
	<li>If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?</li>
</ul>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0cm'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You should also highlight
legal, social and professional impacts of any choices made. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0cm'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>It would certainly be unethical for Abi to analyse and
present data in a way designed to support a specific conclusion. The House of
Commons has published a research briefing which covers various inappropriate
practices, one of which being selectivity as to “formulate [an] argument or
conclusion first, then cherry pick data to support and ‘explain’ this” (Bolton,
2023: 8). This would appear to meet the criteria of selectivity, and so would
clearly be unethical. Instead, Abi should formulate the hypothesis first, and
then objectively determine if the data supports that hypothesis or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Similarly, in order to be ethical and objective, Abi is required
to present his findings in full, both positive and negative (and indeed where
no statistical significance has been found). Again, these should be based upon
the original hypotheses from before the data was seen, not generated
afterwards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Abi cannot be held entirely accountable for how his results
are used, but he is responsible for providing clear and transparent results to reduce
the likelihood, as far as practicable, that they can be misused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Abi should report his results fully and transparently,
including both sets of results if they are both derived satisfactorily from the
original hypotheses. If the results are misused in some way there is then a
trail back to the original results that can be used to objectively find the
facts and not the “spin”.  If Abi is concerned that the manufacturer will cherry
pick pieces of his report to create false conclusions, he should take care to
ensure that the report does not contain ambiguous or misleading statements that
could be used in isolation to draw incorrect conclusions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>By adhering to these principles, Abi might not be popular
with the manufacturer, but he will maintain ethical and legal standards whilst upholding
the integrity of scientific research. This will help to protect his reputation
and career, which is more important than this one job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Worryingly, it seems that whilst the ethical path for Abi
is clear, there is much scope to act unethically. Fraser et al (2018) surveyed 807
researchers and found that over half admitted to at least once engaging in
questionable research practices!</span></p>
