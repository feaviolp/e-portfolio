												<h3>Reflections</h3>
											</header>
											<p><b><u>Unit 1</u></b>
												<br>The lecturecast "Introduction to Machine Learning" provided a really good introduction to many different topics to be covered in the module. This had the greatest depth of information of any lecturecast so far, and it was only the introduction. The videos were well paced and it has certainly made me curious about the rest of the module. 
												<br><br>The first sub-chapter of the core book "An Introduction to Machine Learning" introducted why machine learning is needed without yet getting into the complexities of how to implement it while the online reading gave a bit of history of machine learning. 
												There was a paper on correlation and regression that described some statistics used in machine learning, and whilst I understood the concepts I didn't attempt to work through the equations. 
												Finally, the paper "Deep Learning in Social Computing" gave an interesting insight into social science and computer science come trogehter. It did, however, remind me of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the ethical considerations of using technology for social engineering. 
												<br><br>There was a collaborative discussion about the impact of industry 4.0. I used the example of Boeing 737 MAX where the reckless use of technology caused two plane crashes. My initial post can be found here: 
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Initial post 1.htm" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<p><b><u>Unit 2</u></b>
												<br>The reading for unit 2 was very short and simple, covering the concepts of machine learning. That was luck because the activities this week were very time consuming. 
												<br><br>Exploratory Data Analysis was performed in Python using a provided Jupyter notebook on a sample dataset, in this case relating to house prices. The code was then to be modified to analyse a different dataset concerning miles per gallon of different cars. 
												The chalenge was I didn't have Python, and IDE or Jupyter notebook installed. I tried installing them on my work laptop with limited success due to security policies in place, so I switched to my personal laptop. Here I managed to get them installed, using Pycharm as the IDE after trying unsuccessfully to get Visual Studio Code to work with the correct Python interpreter, but even with the sample code I faced many errors and warnings. After a very long time fault finding I eventually got it to work, albeit with some warnings remaining. 
												Incidentally there were still errors and warnings when running on the Codio environement provided by Essex university, so it seems that the provided code includes some depricated functionality. When I finally got it all working there were some very useful features in the analysis. 
												I'd like to put on record my thanks to  Astrid van Toor for helping me to setup Pycharm when I was facing issues due to having had so many attemtmps with remnants of Python versions including and excluding Anaconda. 
												The executed Jupyter notebooks for both the tutorial and the modified dataset are here:

													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Unit02 Data Analysis - auto-mpg.html" class="button">EDA on auto-mpg</a></li>
												</ul>
												This week also included commenting on other people's posts for the collaborative discussion. I commented on Samuel Adeniyi's post about the 2019 Captial One data breach and Astrid van Toor's post about the 2022 LastPass data breach. 
												<br><br>The groups for the group project were agreed this week. I'm in a group with Astrid van Toor and Anastasia Rizzo. We had a project initialtion call (notes below) where we discussed the project in detail, which is about using an AirBnB data set to pose a question, the answer to which would be useful to AirBnB executives, and then use data analysis to answer the question ina short report. We held a kick-off call where we agreed on a draft question. 
												We agreed to each perform an initial Exploratory Data Analysis which we will each present and discuss at the next meeting. We also agreed a team contract (link below). We have weekly checkpoint meetings scheduled until the project finishes.

											<p><b><u>Unit 3</u></b>
												<br>The seminars appear to be offset by one week in this module, so the unit 2 seminar was in week 3. No matter, I will report them in the week that they happened. 
												The seminar covered Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It was interesting and covered a lot of the topics that we'd already learned in doing the EDA activity so it was a useful to cement the learning. It was also clear that the tutor, Nadeem, was knowledgealbe and passionate about the subject which is a good sign. 
												<br><br>For the team project I performed an initial EDA on the dataset to discuss with the rest of the team. We also had our first weekly checkpoint call:
												<ul class="actions">

													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Checkpoint 1.htm" class="button">Checkpoint 1</a></li>
												</ul>
												I also submitted my summary post for the collaborative discussion:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module4/Summary post 1.htm" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>
												The lecturecast on correlation and regression was the best so far in any module. The worked example on how to calculate simple linear regression using the least square method explained teh steps very clearly was the simplest explanation I've seen. 
												The videos on logistic regression and decision tree were also clearly structed and well paced with simple worked examples in Python using sklearn. 
												<br><br>The reading...
												<br><br>There were also formative activities on correlation and regression. Variables in provided Jupyter notebooks were edited to observe results:
