										<h1>Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct - Summary Post</h1>
								<!--	</header> -->
									
<div class=WordSection1>

<p>In my initial post I provided a fairly sterile comparison of
compliance of the Blocker Plus case study (Association for Computing Machinery,
N.D.) with ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Association for
Computing Machinery, 2018), referred to as “ACM”, and the Code of Conduct for
BCS Members (British Computer Society, 2022), referred to as “BCS”. The two
codes were found to be similar, but with some key gaps, and generally ACM was
more thorough than BCS.</p>

<p>The follow-up discussion was useful in providing more
real-world angles to the analysis. Particularly interesting was the discussion about
the fact that neither code of conduct is legally binding (Lambert, 2023), which
calls into question their real value. I maintained when discussing the Automated
Active Response Weaponry case study, however, that even though they are not
legally binding, a set of ethical standards still has value (Feaviour, 2023a).
We both agreed that the whistle-blowers, which believing they were behaving
ethically, were certainly not behaving lawfully (Lambert, 2023), (Feaviour,
2023a).</p>

<p>Another useful discussion concerned how culpable Blocker
Plus should be for failing to foresee and protect against activists from
corrupting the system. Lambert (2023) argued that it is unreasonable to expect
any system to be completely secure, which I agree with, however I believe that Blocker
Plus could and should have predicted some form of misuse by bad actors, and there
was evidence that they had insufficient protection designed into the system or the
support processes (Feaviour, 2023b). Raneli (2023) agreed, saying “Blocker
Plus's failure to preemptively secure its model and the subsequent difficulty
in rectification suggest a deviation from these ethical expectations”.</p>

<p>In response to a review of Dark UX Patterns (Castro, 2023),
I questioned how accountable a development agency or an individual developer should
be when asked by a customer to do something unethical (Feaviour, 2023c). Bandy
(2023) felt that both the developer and development agency had a duty to adhere
to the principles and act ethically. I agree, but I also understand that the
developer in particular would feel pressure from the agency and would need to weight
up his own ethical principles against his desire to keep a job.</p>

<p>In summary, the ethical principles provide useful ethical
guidance, and the seem to be fairly binary in their interpretation. However,
they operate without legal recourse and within environments where context is
important.</p>
