<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Hi Astrid,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Once again we find ourselves broadly in agreement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>This discussion has made me think about what we mean by
knowledge representation. Before the module started I had assumed it was about
codifying knowledge with, for example, First Order Logic. However, the question
posed about the origins of knowledge representation uncovered things that I had
previously taken for granted and didn’t automatically associate with the
subject. In my own initial post, Feaviour (2023), I mentioned Venn diagrams
(Venn, 1881), Boolean algebra (Boole, 1854) and, like you Aristotle. Upon
reading Balke &amp; Mainzer (2005) from your initial post I can add tree diagrams
being used by Raimundus Lullus in the 13th century, long before Charles Darwin illustrated
the tree of life (Darwin, 1859).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>I realise that this doesn’t add anything to the specific
discussions about whether knowledge representation is new (we both agree that
it isn’t) or whether it is useful without reasoning (we both agree that it is,
albeit less so). I just found it amusing to think about how pervasive some of
the tools are such that I didn’t consciously think of them as being for knowledge
management. If you asked me to name a tool for information storage my first
answer is unlikely to be a pen either!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>I don’t necessarily agree that Weststeijn (2011) provides a
good account of the history of human endeavours in knowledge representation. I
found that, whilst it was interesting, most of the findings were more concerned
with information storage than true knowledge representation, and the efforts to
trace back to the “primitive language” were driven by political and religious
motives, not to mention being futile. Perhaps my own personal views were
influencing how I interpreted it though, and I certainly agree that it had a broad
historical scope. In fact one thing from that paper which you mentioned and I
omitted is knowledge represented in art. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>We took opposing interpretations on the semantics of “knowledge
representation”, but ultimately reached similar conclusions. In my initial
post, Feaviour (2023), I concluded that the desire to represent knowledge dates
back centuries, but the term “knowledge representation” is recent, and so
knowledge representation as an endeavour in not a recent phenomenon. Semantics
aside I think we’re broadly on the same page though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>There are parts of your post that I would contend stray
into information storage/communication rather than knowledge representation.
You make the distinction at the end of the post, but I would say that when you
talk about knowledge transfer (email, audio, video calls, webpages etc.) that
is actually information transfer. In my view the recipient needs to
contextualise it for it to become knowledge. Again, this doesn’t alter the fact
that we fundamentally agree on the conclusion though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Hi Astrid,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>It’s good to question our own reasoning as well as that of
others. However, in this case I believe that we had it right the first time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>In your initial post you said “KR is still useful without
reasoning since it can still represent relevant information, but that KR is
less powerful without this support” (Van Toor, 2023a). In Sam’s initial post he
said “Although KR can still be useful without reasoning support, its
capabilities are limited” (Adeniyi, 2023). In my initial post I said “knowledge
representation on its own does indeed have value, but reasoning elevates it to
a higher level” (Feaviour, 2023). So we all agreed that knowledge
representation has value on its own, but it can be enhanced with the addition
of reasoning. We didn’t quantify how much value knowledge representation has
without reasoning, and I would agree that it can be a lot. But that doesn’t
contradict our initial assertions that reasoning adds even more value. I do
note that in your follow-up you said &quot;KR can be equally useful without
reasoning support&nbsp;&quot; (Van Toor ,2023b) so it looks like you have
indeed changed your position, which is fair enough, but for now I stand behind
my original assertion that however valuable knowledge representation is,
reasoning will always elevate it to a higher value.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>I would also challenge that a map represents knowledge. I
would say that it holds information, and when put into the hands of an
experienced hiker who is perhaps familiar with local weather conditions,
sunrise/sunset times, appropriate hiking equipment etc., it could contribute to
knowledge of when/where to safely hike. Those additional pieces of information held
by the experienced hiker could also be stored somewhere, as separate pieces of
information, and when combined with logical relationships they could be
considered to be a knowledge base, or represented knowledge, which would be
more useful than the map on its own to a novice hiker who doesn’t already have
that knowledge. But if we have a hiker’s sat nav app that recommends a route
based upon the experience level of the hiker, current weather, recent weather, time
of day etc., or perhaps even recommends not to hike at all due to dangerous
conditions, now you’ve hit the jackpot with reasoning. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>All of that is based upon my interpretations of course so I’m
open to be challenged. Especially on the differences between information and
knowledge because I found that it was quite easy to define them conceptually,
as many sources have, but it became much more difficult to find the dividing line
in practice when working through the map example above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

representation” seems to be relatively new precisely to differentiate the term
from the concept, which is why I then went on to give examples of Venn (1881),
Boole (1854) and Aristotle as having an interest in knowledge representation,
albeit under other names. So I think we agree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Your observation that my statement “Reasoning takes the
represented knowledge and makes it actionable when the knowledge is incomplete”
is probably reasonable. I possibly overstated the magnitude of the outcome of
reasoning. Having said that, I would say that updating a belief or creating a
new belief are both actions, so if we accept that the action can be
internalised within the knowledge base then perhaps the definition wasn’t so
bad?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Hi Rory,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>I agree that we could debate the differences between data,
information and knowledge until the end of time and possibly never come to a
hard, unambiguous  definition. So perhaps continuing the debate is futile, but
it’s fun so here we go…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>I agree that the difficulty arises when it comes to
representing knowledge. Defining information and knowledge seems to be more
straightforward, but then when we talk about representing knowledge we start to
run into trouble. So let’s go back to simply defining them:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Ackoff (1989) seems to be heavily cited in papers
discussing data, information, knowledge and wisdom. He says:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>“Data are symbols that represent properties of objects,
events and their environment”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>“Information is contained in <i>descriptions</i>, answers
to questions that begin with such words as <i>who</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>where</i>,
<i>when</i> and <i>how many</i>.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>“Knowledge is know-how, for example, how a system works. It
is what makes possible the transformation of information into <i>instructions.</i>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>Based upon those definitions I would still say that a map
information. The map maker certainly had knowledge when they produced it, but
what is stored in the pages of the map is information. A user with knowledge of
how to read a map can use the information contained to answer questions such as
“how far”, “how steep” etc., but to do that the use has to have knowledge of
how to read a map.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>So the question then is, how then can we represent the knowledge
of the map maker? The answer would seem to be to encode his knowledge into a
map, which is precisely what is done in an ordnance survey may that represents
gradients etc. So now I agree with your and Astrid’s assertion that a map is in
fact a representation of knowledge. The difficulty for me was the difference
between “what is knowledge” and “how to represent knowledge”. I therefore
propose a distinction that says “knowledge can be represented in an artefact,
but once contained within that artefact it is, in and of itself, information”,
or more simply “knowledge can be represented as information”. I think this deals
with your assertion that a map is a representation of knowledge irrespective of
who picks it up, but it also deals with my assertion that it can only be useful
to someone who already has the knowledge of how to read it, because having been
encoded into the map is has become information, needing knowledge to decode.
What do you think? </span></p>
