<p><b>Case: Malicious Inputs to Content Filters</b></p>

<p>The Blocker Plus case (Association for Computing Machinery,
N.D.) has good intentions, but fails to comply with certain ethical standards.
The case will be assessed against ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Association
for Computing Machinery, 2018), referred to as “ACM”, and the Code of Conduct
for BCS Members (British Computer Society, 2022), referred to as “BCS”. The
assessment is divided into legal, professional and social issues.</p>

<p><b>Legal issues</b></p>

<p>“Blocker Plus is complying with U.S. federal regulations to
facilitate socially responsible uses of computers” (Association for Computing
Machinery, N.D.). There is no mention in the case study of Blocker Plus being
used outside of the United States of America, so there don’t appear to be any
issues pertaining to other jurisdictions, although care should be taken if
there were plans to distribute it more widely to ensure compliance with local
jurisdictions. In this regard it is compliant with ACM principle 2.3 “Know and
respect existing rules pertaining to professional work” (where “rules” can be
read as “laws”), and with BCS 3.a “carry out your professional responsibilities
with due care and diligence in accordance with the Relevant Authority’s
requirements whilst exercising your professional judgement at all times”</p>

<p><b>Professional issues</b></p>

<p></p>Blocker Plus failed to “give comprehensive and thorough
evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of
possible risks” (ACM principle 2.5) and “design and implement systems that are
robustly and usably secure” (ACM principle 2.9) because they didn’t foresee and
protect against misuse by activist groups, which ultimately corrupted the
classification model. The closest BCS clause to ACM principle 2.5 appears to be
2.e “respect and value alternative viewpoints and, seek, accept and offer
honest criticisms of work”, however at first blush it would appear that Blocker
Plus is not in breach of that clause on the basis of not foreseeing the risk of
misuse. I suggest that Blocker Plus still failed BCS 2.e on the basis of not
addressing the issue of model corruption when it was first identified because “there
was no easy way to correct the model” (Association for Computing Machinery,
N.D.), but the failing is for a different reason. The closest BCS clause to ACM
principle 2.9 appears to be 2.a “only undertake to do work or provide a service
that is within your professional competence” and whilst in hindsight there were
clearly issues with the product, I find it difficult to argue that professional
competence could have been called into question during development.</p>

<p>By not disclosing the issues with the corrupt model,
Blocker Plus failed ACM principles 1.3 “Be honest and trustworthy” and 2.7 “Foster
public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and
their consequences”. Interestingly, there don’t appear to be  </p>

<p><b>Social Issues</b></p>

<p>Blocker Plus complies with ACM principle 1.1 “Contribute to
society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders
in computing” because it seeks to filter content for children, as designed, but
to have the capability to disable the filters for adults as required. The is
similar to BCS 1.d “promote equal access to the benefits of IT and seek to
promote the inclusion of all sectors in society wherever opportunities arise.”</p>

<p>Due to the issues with the corrupted model incorrectly
blocking legitimate information, Blocker Plus fails principles 1.2 “Avoid harm”
and 1.4 “Be fair and take action not to discriminate”, whilst failing BCS 1.a “have
due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the
environment” and 1.c “conduct your professional activities without
discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, marital status,
nationality, colour, race, ethnic origin, religion, age or disability, or of
any other condition or requirement”.</p>

<p><b>ACM and BCS Comparison</b></p>

<p>There are many similarities between ACM and BCS. Both
provide ethical frameworks for systems and software development, but they are
not identical, with BCS having some gaps, at least as far as this case study is
concerned. ACM is also much more detail, with significantly richer
descriptions.</p>
