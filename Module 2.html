												<h3>Reflections</h3>
											</header>
											<p>When the module started and I saw the week by week breakdown I became nervous about the size of the task I'd taken on. I questioned if I would have the time alongside a demanding full-time job to do all of the required work, especially given I don't have a coding or mathematical background. I was somewhat comforted by possitive messages of support and empathy from other students when I voiced my concerns to the WhatsApp group.</p>
											<p>The Python activities in Codio were well paced and fairly simple. I'm a little concerned that they were too simple so I remain unsure as to my readiness for complex programming. A Python syntax reference guide would've been a useful addition, as well as Linux and HTML.</p>
											<p>The Industry 4.0 seminar felt a bit awkward. Some points were discussed and challenged but it felt forced. Hopefully these sessions will improve as we all get to know each other.</p>
											<p>The discussion work was interesting. It was difficult to understand how to pitch it initially and it felt a little forced, but once the discussions started it developed into a useful learning exercise. The summary post was difficult to understand how to write in an academic and yet personal form, but I expect this will get easier with practice and feedback.</p>
											<p>The reading for unit 3 has been the most challenging to date. The Turing Test by Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy was needlessly verbose and complicated. Chapter 18 of Artificial Intelligencve: A Modern Approach started with some fairly complex writing and made references to chapters that we'd not been directed to read yet. Based upon feedback from other students it looks like the wrong edition was referenced in the VLE because chapter 18 of the previous edition (which is chapter 19 of the new edition) seems to be more relevant.</p>
											<p>The reading for unit 4 was a little challenging too becasue Machine Learning: Hands-On for Developers and Technical Professionals gives examples in Java and Clojure, neither of which I'm familiar with. I followed the concept without going line by line through the code which I think will be enough. The reading on Feature Engineering was interesting too, although I feel a practical example is needed to bring it to life. The seminar this week was awquard with very little interaction. I feel this is probably becasue no-one had time to prepare because the case study was sent very late. I certainly didn't have a chance to read it in advance which was unfortunte.</p>
											<p>The Python exercises on Codio were finally completed in week 5. I feel they were a good introduction but I'll only know how much has stuck when I have my first "proper" Python coding exercise. I downloaded WEKA to my personal lapop and have access it via Codio so ready for next week's seminar. The reading was a continuation of Machine Learning: Hands-On for Developers and Technical Professionals so the same Java and Clojure as before. The concepts are fine though and it will be interesting to see how we do decision trees and clustering on WEKA.</p>
