                      									<p><b>Formative Activity 1.1</b>
											<br>Look at the seven topics described briefly below. Which of them would you consider yourself as ‘knowing’, and which would you consider yourself as having information about?
											<br>
											<br>&emsp;a. A second language in which you are fluent.
											<br>&emsp;b. The content of a television news programme.
											<br>&emsp;c. A close friend.
											<br>&emsp;d. A company’s annual report.
											<br>&emsp;e. Your close friend’s partner whom you have yet to meet.
											<br>&emsp;f. The weather on the other side of the world.
											<br>&emsp;g. The weather where you are now.
											<br><pre><code>I know, or have knowledge about:
											a. A second language in which you are fluent.
											c. A close friend.
											g. The weather where you are now.
											
											I have inforamtion about:
											b. The content of a television news programme.
											d. A company’s annual report.
											e. Your close friend’s partner whom you have yet to meet.
											f. The weather on the other side of the world.</code></pre></p>

											<p><b>Formative Activity 1.1</b>
											<br>What would you suggest is the primary characteristic that distinguishes the ‘having information’ situations from the ‘knowing’ situations you categorised in the previous activity? You will need to make sure that your description does not simply describe information or data but must particularly take account of the former.
											<br><pre><code>Having information is knowing facts. Knowing, or having knowledge, is about having a more detailed and contextualised understanding so the facts can be interpreted to answer questions not immediately obvious from the facts alone.</code></pre></p>

											<p><b><a id="Unit-3-Formative-Activities">Unit 3 Formative Activities</a></b>
                      									<p><b>Formative Activity 3.1</b>
											<br>Attempt the following questions from the module core text:
											<br>
											<br>&emsp;- Chapter 2 Question 4 - The barber's paradox.
											<br>&emsp;- Chapter 3 Question 4 - A Canadian variant of an old puzzle.
											<br><pre><code>Answer here</code></pre></p>
                  
											<p><b>Formative Activity 3.2</b>
											<br>Read the paper by Palomino et al (2005) and review the ‘crossing problem’ diagram provided in the Lecturecast.
											<br>
											<br>Create a set of statements in first order logic (FOL) that represent the states shown – for example you may define two functions left and right and therefore the first state could be represented as: Left(F) and left(W) and Left(G) and left(C). Define your own set of FOL statements for the entire diagram.
											<br>You have been provided with solutions to the ‘crossing problem’ written in Lisp (here), Prolog (here) and Maude (here). Compare your FOL clauses with the various implementations – which of the implementations provides the closest match to your FOL version?

											<p><b><a id="Unit-5-Formative-Activities">Unit 5 Formative Activities</a></b>

											<br>&emsp;- How are these related to ontologies?
											<br><pre><code>Answer here</code></pre></p>

      									                <p><b>Formative Activity 5.2</b>

											<p><b><a id="Unit-6-Formative-Activity">Unit 6 Formative Activity</a></b>
											<br>Read Chapter 3 of Solanki, A (2019) An Introduction to Knowledge Engineering.
											<br>
											<br>&emsp;- Reflect on the various data acquisition methods.
											<br>&emsp;- What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?
											<br>&emsp;- Think about scenarios and which methods would be suitable for each.
											<br><pre><code>Answer here</code></pre></p>

											<p><b><a id="Unit-8-Formative-Activity">Unit 8 Formative Activity</a></b>
											<br>&emsp;- Work through a practical example by following Chapters 3 - 4 of A Practical Guide to Building OWL Ontologies Using Protégé 4 and CO-ODE Tools.
