												<h2>Reflections</h2>
											</header>
											<h3>Unit 1: Scientific Investigation and Ethics</h3>
											<p>
												<br>My first thought when reviewing the content of this module was "wow, it's going to be a lot of work". On a personal note I was informed last week that I'm being made redundant from the company I have worked for for 34 years so I'm feeling anxious on many levels. 
												I'm definitly going to need to get into a good headspace for this module. 
												<br><br>The first seminar was useful because on one hand it confirmed that it's going to be an intensive module, but it also helped to position the module, and the fact that it runs over the Christmas break and so gives a little more time sounds helpful. The tutor,  Steph Paladini, seems helpful too. 
												One recommendation from the seminar was to start using a references manager. I've been doing references manually up to now, but looking at the quantity of references that will be needed for this module, and even more for the final project, I will certainly be looking at that and have downloaded Mendeley to give it a try. 
												<br><br>The reading covered ethics in research, and also the nature of research such as the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning (which I still need to think carefully about to differentiate). There was also a short quiz, but the questions were practically the same as in one of the required readings, although it was still good to practice. 
												Although there was a lot of reading, especially for the first week in a new module, it was actually relatively simple, so I'm feeling a bit less anxious about the module already (I still foresee a huge amount of work though). 
												<br><br>The first collaborative discussion started with a review of a case study from the Association of Computing Machinering (ACM), comparing the case study assessment of the ACM ethics code with the British Computer Society (BCS) code of conduct. My initial post is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Initial post 1.html" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h3>
											<p>
												<br>Unit 2 started with a lecturecast which did a really good job of describing how and why to pose a research question alongside the methods (high level) and importance of a good literatre review. It put this module into context very well. In fact I think it would've been good to have in unit 1, but unit 2 isn't far behind so not a real problem.
												<br><br>The reading, mainly from the core textbook (Dawson, 2015), described why a literature review is important in projects and how to go about it, which is clearly going to be very useful. I found the "spiralling in" concept (Dawson, 2015: 96) particularly useful in appreciating how to itertively focus in on a research topic. There was also a good explanation of when to use Internet sources. I knew that they were less academically sound, but the explanation of using them as a start point for further reserch was a good tip. 
												<br><br>I contributed some peer responses to the colaborative discussion:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Peer responses 1.html" class="button">Peer Responses</a></li>
												</ul>
												I've tried to look into the topics available for the literature review and research proposal, and spent a lot of time this week considering the options, but I'm still struggling to nail down what to select which will help with my final project (the problem being that I don't know what to do for that project eaither). I have some potential options but I think I need to discuss them first to see if they sound reasonable, and how I would get the data needed to build a model.
												<br><br>Some good news; this week I was told that I am no loner being made redundant from work, at least for now. So that stress has now been lifted, although it has taken it's toll.
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 3: Research Methods</h3>
											<p>
												<br>This week the reading was about research design, being exploratory or conclusive, and research methods, being qualitative, quantitative of mixed methods. Each of course is broken down into many more categories such as interviews and surveys for qualitative and experiment and surveys for quantitative (the nature of the survey determining if it is qualitative or quantitative). 
												<br><br>The seminar covered the same topics and emphasised some important points. The "research onion" was a useful model and most useful, to me at least, was the emphasis on defining the right research question to lead to a good research design. This has helped to clarify what is needed for the literature review exercise, in that having been givena list of topics we still need to come up with a specific question within a given topic. I now understad better what is needed to this week I will focus on defining a good question on which to base the literature review.
												<br><br>The seminar also inclued a discussion about the peer review activity. Unfortunately only two students attended the seminar. Mubarak Dada had fully prepared his peer review on two papers and gave a good overview which we discussed and critiqued. I had only completed one paper so we also discussed that and I finished the review with the second paper after the seminar. It was still a useful and interesting discussion and my completed peer review is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Peer review.pdf" class="button">Peer Review</a></li>
												</ul>
												The collaborative discussion finished this week too. My summary post is here:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Summary post 1.html" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>
												I also made my first draft of a research proposal for my final project. There is still too much that I don't yet know to be confident that this will be anything close to the final research question, but it got me thinking about research methods and what the final project could potentially look like, so a good exercise to do in draft at this early stage:
												<br><br>

													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Research proposal review.pdf" class="button">Research proposal review</a></li>
												</ul>											
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The reading this week was very light, covering only research methods such as action research, experimentation, case studies, surveys and observation. This was very welcome, because this week I completed an outline for the literatire review due in unit 7 for formative feedback. If was a very time consuming task to find, read, understanbd, assess to keep/discard, and then comment upon the documents to keep for the literatire review. 
												I haven't summarised all of the documents that I intend to use yet, but there are enough to get some feedback on the approach which I hope will be useful for my final submission in unit 7. My outline literative review is here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Literature review outline.pdf" class="button">Literature review outline</a></li>
												</ul>
												I also completed a short case study on privacy in readiness for next week's seminar:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Case study on privacy.pdf" class="button">Case study on privacy</a></li>
												</ul>
												Finally, I have some concerns about the complexity of gathering the required data for my proposed final project so I have asked for some input from the Steph. I hope to speak with her about it next week.
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods</h3>
											<p>
												<br>There was a lecturecast this week on interviews and surveys, which also covered pre and post-testing to measure changes. It was very basic didn't cover anything that I didn't already know.
												<br><br>The reading from Dawson (2015) covered surveys and interviews at a similarly high-level, although the points on preparing for an interview was a useful checklist. 
												The reading from Berenson et al. (2020) on the other hand suddenly introducted statistical concepts such as standard error rate of the mean and sampling from normal distributions, which whilst relevent to surveys, they seemed to be introduced very abruptly so I have asked for clarification that the reading is correct. 
												<br><br>The seminar provided an opportunity to discuss the case study on privacy that I completed in unit 4. There was pretty good consensus among the students, which was not suprising given the relatively stark conditions in the case study. It was, however,  still a useful exercise to discuss and reflect upon the requirements to treat personal data with care.
												I also briefly discussed my concerns about this week's reading with Steph, who suggested it was likely due to an updated edition of the core textbook, and in any case inferential statistics will be covered in unit 8 so don't worry about it until then. She also breifly mentioned the challenges with the data collection for my proposed final project and suggested that I might want to choose something simpler, but she will proviude more feedback after she's given it more thought after the weekend.
												<br><br>Finally for this week, there was a case study about inappropriate use of surveys, commenting first about the Cambridge Analytica scandal (Confessore, 2018) and then finding another example of inappropriate use of a survey. I discovered that a survey about American support to strike civilian targets (Sagan & Valentino, 2017) was flawed due to it's lack of context, and the reporting of the results even more so (Carpenter et al, 2021). Details are here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Case study Inappropriate use of surveys.pdf" class="button">Case study on Inappropriate use of surveys</a></li>
												</ul>	
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 6: Questionnaire Design</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast on questionnaires was very basic, covering things like the strengths and weaknesses of open and closed questions, and needing to ensure that questions are worded in such a way that they will be interpreted in the same way by people from different backgrounds. 
												It also mentioned that questionnaires should be as short as possible with unnecessary questions omitted. Whilst I agree with that in principle, I reflected upon my case study reponse in unit 5, and the way that providing context in the form of background information or initial positioning questions can increase understanding, so there must be a balance and questionnaires shouldn't be cut down so much that they lose meaning, which I don't think is what was meant anyway. 
												<br><br>The reading went into more detail about questionnaire tools, how to increase response rate, types of questions and the importance of the sequencing of questions, but it was still quite high level. 
												There is additional reading available which I will explore if I choose to include a questionnaire in my final project.
												<br><br>There was a formative activity this week to find and critique a questionnaire on the wiki. I selected the Ofcom Media Attitudes Survey 2021 and found that the biggest issues were the differences in the sequence of the questions and possible answers between the online and paper versions of the same questionnaire, while the wording of the questions were fairly good:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Questionnaires.pdf" class="button">Wiki Activity on Questionnaires</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 7: Validity and Generalisability in Research</h3>
											<p>
												<br>This week the lecturecast concerned validity and generalisability in research, including population vs. sample, methods to remove bias, and differences between qualitative and quantitative research. Like last week the content was very basic, but I have come to value how the lecturecasts in a module help to guide the learning without going into too much detail. 
												<br><br>The reading went into more detail about qualitative research, covering methods that I was broadly already familiar with. What was useful, however, were the examples of where qualitative research is useful, especially in combination with quantitative research such as when qualitiative research seeks to explain the reasons behind the findings of the quantitative research. 
												The short video explaining confounding variables was also useful, showing with a simple example that a confounding varible is a variable other than those being studied that is the true cause of an effect. Not recognising confounding variables can lead to incorrect conclusions about cause and effect. 
												<br><br>The second collaborative discussion started this week with a discussion about a case study concerning the ethics of presenting findings in particular ways. The case study and my initial post are here:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Initial post 2.html" class="button">Initial Post</a></li>
												</ul>
												Finally, I completed and submitted my literature review for assessment:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Literature review.pdf" class="button">Literature review</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 8: Inferential Statistics</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast and reading covered many of the statistical concepts previously covered in the Numerical Analysis module such as levels of measurement (ratio, interval, ordinal and nominal scales), discrete and continuous variables, the differences between and uses of mean, median and mode, skewness of data and hypothesis testing. 
												There was not much new, but it was useful to be reminded of these methods prior to the beginning the final project where they might be needed, and some of the descriptions provided useful clarifications that I had not come across before, such as a nice visualisation of boxplots alongside skewed distributions. 
												There were also some new concepts, such as the coeffecient of variation which I don't recall from the Numerical Analysis module.
												<br><br>The formative activities this week were some exercises in Excel to practice summary measures and hypothesis testing. I'm relatively proficient in Excel so the summary measures were straightforward, but I didn't realise that it was possible to calculate a t-test using the Data Analysis feature so that was very useful to learn:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Summary Measures.pdf" class="button">Summary Measures</a></li>
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Hypothesis Testing.pdf" class="button">Hypothesis Testing</a></li>
												</ul>
												The seminar continued the discussion on statistical topics such as descriptive and inferential statistics, data types, central tendency and appropriate use of statistics. As with the reading it was largely a refresher of learning previously covered in the numerical analysis module, but it was still useful to run through this close to starting the final project. 
												It was also very useful to get clarification that the final project does not necessarily have to include any statistical analysis at all. Rather than analysing primary and/or secondary data, if the project includes an artefact such as a machine learnig model, the performance measures of the model, such as accuracy, precision and f1-score could be used in place of statistical analysis of data.
												<br><br>I provided two peer responses for the second collaborative discussion because only two other people provided an initial post in time. The discussion topic seemed to be quite straightforward and I felt there was a risk that everyone would just say the same thing, leaving little to discuss. Fortunately Dominic took a differing view which gave scope for some debate: 
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Peer responses 2.html" class="button">Peer Responses</a></li>
												</ul>
												Finally, I submitted a research proposal outline for formative feedback prior to submitting the final version in unit 10. I still haven't decided what my final project is going to be, so for my reearch proposal presentation I will continue with the same topic from the earlier literature review:
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Research proposal outline.pdf" class="button">Research proposal outline</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 9: Analysing Qualitative Data</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The reading, once againt primarily from Berensen et al. (2020), described various ways to visualise data, such as different chart types and recomendations on when to use them. There were also some useful recommendations on chart types NOT to use due to visual distortions.
												<br><br>Continuing from the practical exercises in Excel from last week, there was a formative activivty on charts. The standard bar chart was easy, but the method for manually producing a histogram was useful but quite complicated, so I re-did it a couple of times to practice:
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Charts.pdf" class="button">Charts</a></li>
												</ul>
												The seminar covered similar ground to the reading, discussion different chart types, but also the merits of differnt tools such as Excel, Power BI, Tableau and Qlik. A "visual vocabulary" from the Financial Times was also shared which is a really useful reference of when to use different visualisations. 
												<br><br>I provided my summary post for the second collaborative discussion: 
												<br><br>
												<ul class="actions">
													<li><a href="Modules/Module7/Summary post 2.html" class="button">Summary Post</a></li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3>Unit 10: Research Writing</h3>
											<p>
												<br>The lecturecast was very short and simple, simply providing a very high level overview of some of the requiremetns of the final project. There was no new information, but it was still a good reminder of how to structure the contents and methodology for teh project, so when I finaly settle on the scope of my project I will likely refer back here to make sure that I start the project in the right direction.
												<br><br>The reading returned to Dawson (2015), describing how to write a research project. Much of the content repeated last week's reading, such as when to use different chart types, but there was also some useful information about how to approach the writting, when to start etc., and a very usefuol description of how different chapters should relate to each other that I think will be particularly useful when writting the final dissertation.
												The University of Essex paper on "How to wite a research project" was also a good read and one that I have saved to refer back to throughout the dissertation.
												<br><br>The TED Talk about procrastination was hillarious. I've seen it before but it's still funny and very relevent. I actually don't suffer too much from procrastination, but "the instant gratification monkey" is still something that I can relate to and something that will definitly need to be kept in check during my dissertatation to avoid waking "the panic monster"!
												<br><br>I updated my professional skills matrix and action plan in readiness for next week's seminar, which can be found at the bottom of this page (TO DO).
												<br><br>I also submitted my research proposal presentation for assessment. The slides are here:
